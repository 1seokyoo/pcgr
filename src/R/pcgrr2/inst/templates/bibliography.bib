  abstract    = "Alterations in DNA repair pathways are common in tumors and
                 can result in characteristic mutational signatures; however, a
                 specific mutational signature associated with somatic
                 alterations in the nucleotide- excision repair (NER) pathway
                 has not yet been identified. Here we examine the mutational
                 processes operating in urothelial cancer, a tumor type in
                 which the core NER gene ERCC2 is significantly mutated.
                 Analysis of three independent urothelial tumor cohorts
                 demonstrates a strong association between somatic ERCC2
                 mutations and the activity of a mutational signature
                 characterized by a broad spectrum of base changes. In
                 addition, we note an association between the activity of this
                 signature and smoking that is independent of ERCC2 mutation
                 status, providing genomic evidence of tobacco-related
                 mutagenesis in urothelial cancer. Together, these analyses
                 identify an NER-related mutational signature and highlight the

                 broad sequencing of cancer genomes and reflect underlying
                 processes of mutagenesis. The clinical application of
                 mutational signatures is not well defined. Here we aim to
                 assess the prognostic utility of mutational signatures in
                 ovarian high grade serous carcinoma. METHODS: Open access data
                 of 15,439 somatic mutations of 310 ovarian high grade serous
                 carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are used to
                 construct a Bayesian model to classify each cancer as either
                 having or lacking a BRCA1/2 mutational signature. We evaluate
                 the association of the BRCA1/2 signature with overall survival
                 on the TCGA dataset and on an independent cohort of 92 ovarian
                 high grade serous carcinomas from the Australian Ovarian
                 Cancer Study (AOCS). RESULTS: Patients from TCGA with tumors
                 harboring the BRCA1/2 mutational signature have improved
                 survival (55.2 months vs. 38.0 months), which is independent
                 of BRCA1/2 gene mutation status, age, stage and grade (HR =
                 0.64, p = 0.02). In the AOCS dataset, the BRCA1/2 mutational
                 signature is also associated with improved overall survival
                 (46.3 months vs. 23.6 months) independent of age and stage (HR
                 = 0.52, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: A BRCA1/2 mutational
                 signature is a prognostic marker in ovarian high grade serous
                 carcinoma. Mutational signature analysis of ovarian cancer
                 genomes may be useful in addition to testing for BRCA1/2
                 mutations. IMPACT: This study identifies the use of mutational
                 signatures as a biomarker for survival outcome in ovarian high

                 targeted therapy trials have thus far been disappointing owing
                 to a lack of robust stratification methods. Whole-genome
                 sequencing (WGS) analysis of 129 cases demonstrated that this
                 is a heterogeneous cancer dominated by copy number alterations

                 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and/or downstream mitogenic
                 activation is almost ubiquitous; thus tailored combination RTK
                 inhibitor (RTKi) therapy might be required, as we demonstrate
                 in vitro. However, mutational signatures showed three distinct
                 molecular subtypes with potential therapeutic relevance, which
                 we verified in an independent cohort (n = 87): (i) enrichment

                 recombination pathway; (ii) dominant T>G mutational pattern

                 become increasingly critical. Although error rates for

                 However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
                 web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that
                 are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies.
                 Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex
                 questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This
                 article introduces a new software suite for the comparison,
                 manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser
                 Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format.
                 BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments
                 in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are
                 extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large
                 datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both
                 public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be
                 combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX
                 commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as
                 pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large

  abstract    = "Oncotator is a tool for annotating genomic point mutations and
                 short nucleotide insertions/deletions (indels) with variant-
                 and gene-centric information relevant to cancer researchers.
                 This information is drawn from 14 different publicly available
                 resources that have been pooled and indexed, and we provide an
                 extensible framework to add additional data sources.
                 Annotations linked to variants range from basic information,
                 such as gene names and functional classification (e.g.
                 missense), to cancer-specific data from resources such as the
                 Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), the Cancer
                 Gene Census, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For local
                 use, Oncotator is freely available as a python module hosted
                 on Github (https://github.com/broadinstitute/oncotator).
                 Furthermore, Oncotator is also available as a web service and

                 feasibility of drug sensitivity prediction, several studies
                 have measured drug responses for cytotoxic and targeted

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: A key goal of computational personalized medicine
                 is to systematically utilize genomic and other molecular
                 features of samples to predict drug responses for a previously
                 unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for developing
                 hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual
                 patients. This is especially valuable in oncology, where
                 molecular and genetic heterogeneity of the cells has a major
                 impact on the response. However, the prediction task is
                 extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can
                 effectively model and predict drug responses. RESULTS: In this
                 study, we propose a novel formulation of multi-task matrix
                 factorization that allows selective data integration for
                 predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we
                 extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix
                 factorization (KBMF) method with component-wise multiple
                 kernel learning. In addition, our approach exploits the known
                 pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful
                 fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method
                 quantitatively outperforms the state of the art on predicting
                 drug responses in two publicly available cancer datasets as
                 well as on a synthetic dataset. In addition, we validated our
                 model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house
                 cancer cell line panel. We finally show the practical
                 applicability of the proposed method by utilizing prior
                 knowledge to infer pathway-drug response associations, opening
                 up the opportunity for elucidating drug action mechanisms. We
                 demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned
                 by the proposed model for the well-known EGFR and MEK
                 inhibitors. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code

                 varying molecular characteristics of different tumor types may
                 lead to resistance to certain drugs. As a result, the same
                 drug can lead to significantly different results in different
                 types of cancer thus emphasizing the need for individualized
                 medicine. Individual prediction of drug response has great
                 potential to aid in improving the clinical outcome and reduce
                 the financial costs associated with prescribing chemotherapy
                 drugs to which the patient's tumor might be resistant. In this
                 paper we develop a network based classifier (NBC) method for
                 predicting sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs from
                 transcriptome data. In the literature, this strategy has been
                 used for predicting cancer types. Here, we extend it to
                 estimate sensitivity of cells from different tumor types to
                 various anticancer drugs. Furthermore, we incorporate domain
                 specific knowledge such as the use of apoptotic gene list and
                 clinical dose information in our method to impart biological
                 significance to the prediction. Our experimental results

                 important tool in predicting outcome; however, it is unclear
                 whether such genomic analysis alone can adequately predict
                 therapeutic response. We evaluated the ability of GEP to
                 predict complete response (CR) in MM. GEP from pretreatment MM
                 cells from 136 uniformly treated MM patients with response
                 data on an IFM, France led study were analyzed. To evaluate
                 variability in predictive power due to microarray platform or
                 treatment types, additional data sets from three different
                 studies (n=511) were analyzed using same methods. We used
                 several machine learning methods to derive a prediction model
                 using training and test subsets of the original four data
                 sets. Among all methods employed for GEP-based CR predictive
                 capability, we got accuracy range of 56-78\% in test data sets
                 and no significant difference with regard to GEP platforms,
                 treatment regimens or in newly diagnosed or relapsed patients.
                 Importantly, permuted P-value showed no statistically
                 significant CR predictive information in GEP data. This
                 analysis suggests that GEP-based signature has limited power

                 normal tissues, or whether different tumor types exhibit
                 similar metabolic changes. Here we compare expression patterns

                 Overall, the metabolic gene expression program in tumors is
                 similar to that in the corresponding normal tissues. Although
                 expression changes of some metabolic pathways (e.g.,
                 upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and glycolysis) are
                 frequently observed across tumors, expression changes of other

  abstract    = "The three dimensional (3D) architecture of chromosomes is not
                 random but instead tightly organized due to chromatin folding
                 and chromatin interactions between genomically distant loci.
                 By bringing genomically distant functional elements such as
                 enhancers and promoters into close proximity, these
                 interactions play a key role in regulating gene expression.
                 Some of these interactions are dynamic, that is, they differ
                 between cell types, conditions and can be induced by specific
                 stimuli or differentiation events. Other interactions are more
                 structural and stable, that is they are constitutionally
                 present across several cell types. Genome contact interactions
                 can occur via recruitment and physical interaction between
                 chromatin-binding proteins and correlate with epigenetic marks
                 such as histone modifications. Absence of a contact can occur
                 due to presence of insulators, that is, chromatin-bound
                 complexes that physically separate genomic loci. Understanding
                 which contacts occur or do not occur in a given cell type is
                 important since it can help explain how genes are regulated
                 and which functional elements are involved in such regulation.
                 The analysis of genome contact interactions has been greatly
                 facilitated by the relatively recent development of chromosome
                 conformation capture (3C). In an even more recent development,
                 3C was combined with next generation sequencing and led to
                 Hi-C, a technique that in theory queries all possible pairwise
                 interactions both within the same chromosome (intra) and
                 between chromosomes (inter). Hi-C has now been used to study
                 genome contact interactions in several human and mouse cell
                 types as well as in animal models such as Drosophila and
                 yeast. While it is fair to say that Hi-C has revolutionized
                 the study of chromatin interactions, the computational
                 analysis of Hi-C data is extremely challenging due to the
                 presence of biases, artifacts, random polymer ligation and the
                 huge number of potential pairwise interactions. In this
                 chapter, we outline a strategy for analysis of genome contact

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Identification of altered pathways that are
                 clinically relevant across human cancers is a key challenge in
                 cancer genomics. Precise identification and understanding of
                 these altered pathways may provide novel insights into patient
                 stratification, therapeutic strategies and the development of
                 new drugs. However, a challenge remains in accurately
                 identifying pathways altered by somatic mutations across human
                 cancers, due to the diverse mutation spectrum. We developed an
                 innovative approach to integrate somatic mutation data with
                 gene networks and pathways, in order to identify pathways
                 altered by somatic mutations across cancers. RESULTS: We
                 applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset
                 of somatic mutations in 4790 cancer patients with 19 different
                 types of tumors. Our analysis identified cancer-type-specific
                 altered pathways enriched with known cancer-relevant genes and
                 targets of currently available drugs. To investigate the
                 clinical significance of these altered pathways, we performed
                 consensus clustering for patient stratification using member
                 genes in the altered pathways coupled with gene expression
                 datasets from 4870 patients from TCGA, and multiple
                 independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could
                 be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly
                 different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance,
                 certain patient subpopulations with poor prognosis were
                 identified because they had specific altered pathways for
                 which there are available targeted therapies. These findings
                 could be used to tailor and intensify therapy in these
                 patients, for whom current therapy is suboptimal. AVAILABILITY

                 provide the opportunity to evaluate the predictive utility of
                 molecular data for clinical drug responses in multiple cancer
                 types. RESULTS: Here, we first curated the drug treatment
                 information from TCGA. Four chemotherapeutic drugs had more
                 than 180 clinical response records. Then, we developed a
                 computational framework to evaluate the molecule based
                 predictions of clinical responses of the four drugs and to
                 identify the corresponding molecular signatures. Results show
                 that mRNA or miRNA expressions can predict drug responses
                 significantly better than random classifiers in specific
                 cancer types. A few signature genes are involved in drug
                 response related pathways, such as DDB1 in DNA repair pathway
                 and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. Finally, we applied the
                 framework to predict responses across multiple cancer types
                 and found that the prediction performances get improved for
                 cisplatin based on miRNA expressions. Integrative analysis of

                 opportunities for discovering predictive markers in cancer.

                 of their therapeutic potential and possible adverse effects,
                 thereby accelerating and de-risking drug discovery process.
                 Given the high costs of experimental profiling of the complete
                 target space of drug-like compounds, computational models
                 offer systematic means for guiding these mapping efforts.
                 These models suggest the most potent interactions for further
                 experimental or pre-clinical evaluation both in cell line
                 models and in patient-derived material. AREAS COVERED: The
                 authors focus here on network-based machine learning models
                 and their use in the prediction of novel compound-target
                 interactions both in target-based and phenotype-based drug
                 discovery applications. While currently being used mainly in
                 complementing the experimentally mapped compound-target
                 networks for drug repurposing applications, such as extending
                 the target space of already approved drugs, these network

                 demonstrated that network-centric modeling approaches have the
                 potential to identify candidate compounds and selective
                 targets in disease networks, many challenges still remain. In
                 particular, these challenges include how to incorporate the
                 cellular context and genetic background into the disease
                 networks to enable more stratified and selective target
                 predictions, as well as how to make the prediction models more

                 cancer cells could offer promising new therapeutic targets.
                 Large-scale functional genomic screening presents an
                 opportunity to test large numbers of cancer synthetic lethal
                 hypotheses. Methods enriching for candidate synthetic lethal
                 targets in molecularly defined cancer cell lines can steer
                 effective design of screening efforts. Loss of one partner of
                 a synthetic lethal gene pair creates a dependency on the
                 other, thus synthetic lethal gene pairs should never show
                 simultaneous loss-of-function. We have developed a
                 computational approach to mine large multi-omic cancer data
                 sets and identify gene pairs with mutually exclusive
                 loss-of-function. Since loss-of-function may not always be
                 genetic, we look for deleterious mutations, gene deletion
                 and/or loss of mRNA expression by bimodality defined with a
                 novel algorithm BiSEp. RESULTS: Applying this toolkit to both
                 tumour cell line and patient data, we achieve statistically
                 significant enrichment for experimentally validated tumour
                 suppressor genes and synthetic lethal gene pairings. Notably
                 non-reliance on genetic loss reveals a number of known
                 synthetic lethal relationships otherwise missed, resulting in
                 marked improvement over genetic-only predictions. We go on to
                 establish biological rationale surrounding a number of novel
                 candidate synthetic lethal gene pairs with demonstrated
                 dependencies in published cancer cell line shRNA screens.
                 CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a multi-omic approach to
                 define gene loss-of-function, and enrich for candidate
                 synthetic lethal gene pairs in cell lines testable through
                 functional screens. In doing so, we offer an additional
                 resource to generate new cancer drug target and combination
                 hypotheses. Algorithms discussed are freely available in the

                 is a devastating disease, and contemporary chemotherapeutic
                 strategies now integrate several agents in the treatment of
                 some types of cancer, with the intent to block more than one

                 diseases. Synergistic drug combinations could provide an
                 effective strategy to overcome drug resistance. Meanwhile,
                 synergistic drug combinations can increase treatment efficacy
                 and decrease drug dosage to avoid toxicity. Therefore,
                 computational prediction of synergistic drug combinations for

                 Testing drugs on patients in clinical trial is the only way to
                 evaluate the efficacy of drugs. The approach is labour
                 intensive and requires overwhelming costs and a number of
                 experiments. Therefore, preclinical model system has been
                 intensively investigated for predicting the efficacy of drugs.
                 Current computational drug sensitivity prediction approaches
                 use general biological network modules as their prediction
                 features. Therefore, they miss indirect effectors or the
                 effects from tissue-specific interactions. RESULTS: We
                 developed cell line specific functional modules. Enriched
                 scores of functional modules are utilized as cell line
                 specific features to predict the efficacy of drugs. Cell line
                 specific functional modules are clusters of genes, which have
                 similar biological functions in cell line specific networks.
                 We used linear regression for drug efficacy prediction. We
                 assessed the prediction performance in leave-one-out
                 cross-validation (LOOCV). Our method was compared with elastic
                 net model, which is a popular model for drug efficacy

                 sensitivity-associated functions of five drugs - lapatinib,
                 erlotinib, raloxifene, tamoxifen and gefitinib- by our model.

                 for improving treatment response in clinical use. However, to
                 really capitalize on the polypharmacological effects of drugs,
                 there is a critical need to better model and understand how
                 the complex interactions between drugs and their cellular
                 targets contribute to drug efficacy and possible side effects.
                 Network graphs provide a convenient modeling framework for
                 dealing with the fact that most drugs act on cellular systems
                 through targeting multiple proteins both through on-target and
                 off-target binding. Network pharmacology models aim at
                 addressing questions such as how and where in the disease
                 network should one target to inhibit disease phenotypes, such
                 as cancer growth, ideally leading to therapies that are less

                 attacking the disease network at the systems level through

                 resulted in biomarkers predictive of drug response, but the
                 majority of response is not captured by current methods.
                 Methods typically select single biomarkers or groups of
                 related biomarkers but do not account for response that is
                 strictly dependent on many simultaneous genetic alterations.
                 This shortcoming reflects the combinatorics and
                 multiple-testing problem associated with many-body biologic
                 interactions. We developed a novel approach, Multivariate
                 Organization of Combinatorial Alterations (MOCA), to partially
                 address these challenges. Extending on previous work that
                 accounts for pairwise interactions, the approach rapidly
                 combines many genomic alterations into biomarkers of drug
                 response, using Boolean set operations coupled with
                 optimization; in this framework, the union, intersection, and
                 difference Boolean set operations are proxies of molecular
                 redundancy, synergy, and resistance, respectively. The
                 algorithm is fast, broadly applicable to cancer genomics data,
                 is of immediate use for prioritizing cancer pharmacogenomics
                 experiments, and recovers known clinical findings without
                 bias. Furthermore, the results presented here connect many

                 estimate the frequency of such incidental findings in patients
                 of European and African ancestry, we classified potentially
                 actionable pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in all
                 4300 European- and 2203 African-ancestry participants

                 considered 112 gene-disease pairs selected by an expert panel
                 as associated with medically actionable genetic disorders that
                 may be undiagnosed in adults. The resulting classifications
                 were compared to classifications from other clinical and
                 research genetic testing laboratories, as well as with in
                 silico pathogenicity scores. Among European-ancestry
                 participants, 30 of 4300 (0.7\%) had a pathogenic SNV and six
                 (0.1\%) had a disruptive variant that was expected to be
                 pathogenic, whereas 52 (1.2\%) had likely pathogenic SNVs. For
                 African-ancestry participants, six of 2203 (0.3\%) had a
                 pathogenic SNV and six (0.3\%) had an expected pathogenic
                 disruptive variant, whereas 13 (0.6\%) had likely pathogenic

                 of the available anticancer agents in order to improve
                 treatment. As a result of the ever-growing numbers of
                 druggable molecular targets and possible drug combinations,
                 obtaining an optimal toxicity-efficacy balance is an
                 increasingly complex task. Consequently, standard empirical
                 approaches to optimizing drug dosing and scheduling in
                 patients are now of limited utility; mathematical modelling
                 can substantially advance this practice through improved
                 rationalization of therapeutic strategies. The implementation
                 of mathematical modelling tools is an emerging trend, but

              mutations, is believed to contribute to the heterogeneous drug
              responses in patient cohorts. However, it is difficult to
              discover personalized driver mutations that are predictive of
              drug sensitivity owing to diverse and complex mutations of
              individual patients. To circumvent this problem, a novel
              computational method is presented to discover potential drug
              sensitivity relevant cancer subtypes and identify driver mutation
              modules of individual subtypes by coupling differentially
              expressed genes (DEGs) based subtyping analysis with the driver
              mutation network analysis. RESULTS: The proposed method was
              applied to breast cancer and lung cancer samples available from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cancer subtypes were uncovered
              with significantly different survival rates, and more
              interestingly, distinct driver mutation modules were also
              discovered among different subtypes, indicating the potential
              mechanism of heterogeneous drug sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The
              research findings can be used to help guide the repurposing of
              known drugs and their combinations in order to target these
              dysfunctional modules and their downstream signaling effectively

                 selective pressures exerted by therapy, Gerlinger et al [1],
                 Greaves and Maley [2]. Techniques allowing the systematic
                 evaluation of the tumor genome, particularly Next-Generation
                 Sequencing (NGS), now have performance characteristics and
                 costs which allow them to be integrated into routine clinical
                 care and drug development, Frampton et al [3]. It is therefore
                 pertinent to reevaluate the drug development and approval
                 process of oncology therapies in light of these
                 developments.Although it is too early to predict the extent to
                 which NGS will transform oncology, it will likely become an
                 important tool in routine diagnostics and, when combined with
                 the use of treatment/matching algorithms(1) based on the
                 clinical relevance of mutational profiles, will have a
                 beneficial effect on patient outcomes. Along with advances in
                 immunotherapy, NGS, as a basis of selecting targeted therapies
                 for cancer patients, should be incorporated into strategic
                 planning for the future of oncology drug development. In the
                 future, integrative systems biology approaches encompassing
                 epigenomics, pathway analysis, and insights derived from the
                 tumor microenvironment, in addition to genomics, are expected
                 to lead to improved decision making. The use of NGS to
                 elucidate the impact of somatic genomic alterations on
                 treatment outcomes is an important first step, even if current
                 attempts to match patients to targeted therapies have yielded
                 low rates of actionability (13\%, Andre et al [4]) for rare
                 variants.Clinical trials will need to become more
                 patient-centric (as opposed to drug-centric) when NGS- or
                 molecular profiling-driven trials are conducted, since
                 treatments will become more individualized.We recommend that
                 NGS-driven trials and the development of treatment algorithms
                 are further explored, potentially including public-private

                 resistance to anticancer therapies requires prospective
                 patient follow-up and clinical and functional validation of
                 both common and low-frequency mutations. We describe a
                 whole-exome sequencing (WES) precision medicine trial focused
                 on patients with advanced cancer. OBJECTIVE: To understand how
                 WES data affect therapeutic decision making in patients with
                 advanced cancer and to identify novel biomarkers of response.
                 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients with metastatic and
                 treatment-resistant cancer were prospectively enrolled at a
                 single academic center for paired metastatic tumor and normal
                 tissue WES during a 19-month period (February 2013 through
                 September 2014). A comprehensive computational pipeline was
                 used to detect point mutations, indels, and copy number
                 alterations. Mutations were categorized as category 1, 2, or 3
                 on the basis of actionability; clinical reports were generated
                 and discussed in precision tumor board. Patients were observed
                 for 7 to 25 months for correlation of molecular information
                 with clinical response. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
                 Feasibility, use of WES for decision making, and
                 identification of novel biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 154
                 tumor-normal pairs from 97 patients with a range of metastatic
                 cancers were sequenced, with a mean coverage of 95X and 16
                 somatic alterations detected per patient. In total, 16
                 mutations were category 1 (targeted therapy available), 98
                 were category 2 (biologically relevant), and 1474 were
                 category 3 (unknown significance). Overall, WES provided
                 informative results in 91 cases (94\%), including alterations
                 for which there is an approved drug, there are therapies in
                 clinical or preclinical development, or they are considered
                 drivers and potentially actionable (category 1-2); however,
                 treatment was guided in only 5 patients (5\%) on the basis of
                 these recommendations because of access to clinical trials
                 and/or off-label use of drugs. Among unexpected findings, a
                 patient with prostate cancer with exceptional response to
                 treatment was identified who harbored a somatic hemizygous
                 deletion of the DNA repair gene FANCA and putative partial
                 loss of function of the second allele through germline
                 missense variant. Follow-up experiments established that loss
                 of FANCA function was associated with platinum
                 hypersensitivity both in vitro and in patient-derived
                 xenografts, thus providing biologic rationale and functional
                 evidence for his extreme clinical response. CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: The majority of advanced, treatment-resistant
                 tumors across tumor types harbor biologically informative
                 alterations. The establishment of a clinical trial for WES of
                 metastatic tumors with prospective follow-up of patients can
                 help identify candidate predictive biomarkers of response.",

              and genes into close spatial proximity to ensure proper,
              cell-type specific gene expression profiles. Here, we performed
              Hi-C chromosome conformation capture sequencing to investigate
              how three-dimensional chromatin organization is disrupted in the
              context of copy number variation, long-range epigenetic
              remodelling and atypical gene expression programs in prostate
              cancer. We find that cancer cells retain the ability to segment
              their genomes into megabase-sized topologically associated
              domains (TADs), however these domains are generally smaller due
              to establishment of additional domain boundaries. Interestingly,
              a large proportion of the new cancer-specific domain boundaries
              occur at regions that display copy number variation. Notably, a
              common deletion on 17p13.1 in prostate cancer spanning the TP53
              tumour suppressor locus results in bifurcation of a single TAD
              into two distinct smaller TADs. Change in domain structure is
              also accompanied by novel cancer-specific chromatin interactions
              within the TADs that are enriched at regulatory elements such as
              enhancers, promoters and insulators, and associated with
              alterations in gene expression. We also show that differential
              chromatin interactions across regulatory regions occur within
              long-range epigenetically activated or silenced regions of
              concordant gene activation or repression in prostate cancer.
              Finally, we present a novel visualisation tool that enables
              integrated exploration of Hi-C interaction data, the
              transcriptome and epigenome. This study provides new insights
              into the relationship between long-range epigenetic and genomic

                 multiple HTS datasets as unbiased benchmarks. Particularly,
                 the utility of our method was robustly demonstrated in
                 identifying novel DR candidates. Second, we predicted 14
                 high-scoring DR candidates solely based on expression
                 signatures. Eight of the fourteen drugs showed significant
                 anti-proliferative activity against glioblastoma; i.e.,
                 ivermectin, trifluridine, astemizole, amlodipine, maprotiline,
                 apomorphine, mometasone, and nortriptyline. Our DR score
                 strongly correlated with that of cell-based experimental
                 results; the top seven DR candidates were positive,
                 corresponding to an approximately 20-fold enrichment compared
                 with conventional HTS. Despite diverse original indications
                 and known targets, the perturbed pathways of active DR
                 candidates show five distinct patterns that form tight
                 clusters together with one or more known cancer drugs,
                 suggesting common transcriptome-level mechanisms of
                 anti-proliferative activity.",

                 strategy widely used as it may improve efficacy and reduce
                 side-effect (SE). Since it is impractical to screen all
                 possible drug combinations for every indication, computational
                 methods have been developed to predict new combinations. In
                 this study, we describe a novel approach that utilizes
                 clinical SEs from post-marketing surveillance and the drug
                 label to predict 1,508 novel drug-drug combinations. It
                 outperforms other prediction methods, achieving an AUC of 0.92
                 compared to an AUC of 0.69 in a previous method, on a much
                 larger drug combination set (245 drug combinations in our
                 dataset compared to 75 in previous work.). We further found
                 from the feature selection that three FDA black-box warned
                 serious SEs, namely pneumonia, haemorrhage rectum, and retinal
                 bleeding, contributed mostly to the predictions and a model
                 only using these three SEs can achieve an average area under
                 curve (AUC) at 0.80 and accuracy at 0.91, potentially with its
                 simplicity being recognized as a practical rule-of-three in
                 drug co-prescription or making fixed-dose drug combination. We

                 cancer cell to respond to a particular therapeutic agent can
                 facilitate the development of precision cancer medicines.
                 Cancer cell-line (CCL) profiling of small-molecule sensitivity
                 has emerged as an unbiased method to assess the relationships
                 between genetic or cellular features of CCLs and
                 small-molecule response. Here, we developed annotated cluster
                 multidimensional enrichment analysis to explore the
                 associations between groups of small molecules and groups of
                 CCLs in a new, quantitative sensitivity dataset. This analysis
                 reveals insights into small-molecule mechanisms of action, and
                 genomic features that associate with CCL response to
                 small-molecule treatment. We are able to recapitulate known
                 relationships between FDA-approved therapies and cancer
                 dependencies and to uncover new relationships, including for
                 KRAS-mutant cancers and neuroblastoma. To enable the cancer
                 community to explore these data, and to generate novel
                 hypotheses, we created an updated version of the Cancer
                 Therapeutic Response Portal (CTRP v2). SIGNIFICANCE: We
                 present the largest CCL sensitivity dataset yet available, and
                 an analysis method integrating information from multiple CCLs
                 and multiple small molecules to identify CCL response
                 predictors robustly. We updated the CTRP to enable the cancer

                 However, no agreed-upon standard exists for calling
                 locus-specific amplifications and deletions in each patient

                 number amplitude and length with gene expression across 6,109
                 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset across 16
                 cancer types. Using specificity, sensitivity, and
                 precision-based scores, we assigned optimized amplitude and
                 length cutoffs for nine recurrent SCNAs affecting known
                 oncogenic drivers, using mRNA expression as a functional
                 readout. These cutoffs captured the majority of SCNA-driven,
                 highly-expression-altered samples. The majority of oncogenes
                 required only amplitude cutoffs, as high amplitude samples
                 were almost invariably focal; however, CDKN2A and PTEN
                 uniquely required both amplitude and length cutoffs as primary
                 predictors. For PTEN, these extended to downstream AKT
                 activation. In contrast, SCNA genes located peri-telomerically
                 or in fragile sites showed poor expression-copy number
                 correlations. Overall, our analyses identify optimized
                 amplitude and length cutoffs as efficient predictors of gene
                 expression changes for specific oncogenic SCNAs, yet warn
                 against one-size-fits-all interpretations across all loci. Our

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Personalized therapy provides the best outcome of
                 cancer care and its implementation in the clinic has been
                 greatly facilitated by recent convergence of enormous progress
                 in basic cancer research, rapid advancement of new tumor
                 profiling technologies, and an expanding compendium of
                 targeted cancer therapeutics. METHODS: We developed a
                 personalized cancer therapy (PCT) program in a clinical
                 setting, using an integrative genomics approach to fully
                 characterize the complexity of each tumor. We carried out
                 whole exome sequencing (WES) and single-nucleotide
                 polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping on DNA from tumor and
                 patient-matched normal specimens, as well as RNA sequencing
                 (RNA-Seq) on available frozen specimens, to identify somatic
                 (tumor-specific) mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs),
                 gene expression changes, gene fusions, and also germline
                 variants. To provide high sensitivity in known cancer mutation
                 hotspots, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2) was
                 also employed. We integrated the resulting data with cancer
                 knowledge bases and developed a specific workflow for each
                 cancer type to improve interpretation of genomic data.
                 RESULTS: We returned genomics findings to 46 patients and
                 their physicians describing somatic alterations and predicting
                 drug response, toxicity, and prognosis. Mean 17.3
                 cancer-relevant somatic mutations per patient were identified,
                 13.3-fold, 6.9-fold, and 4.7-fold more than could have been
                 detected using CHPv2, Oncomine Cancer Panel (OCP), and
                 FoundationOne, respectively. Our approach delineated the
                 underlying genetic drivers at the pathway level and provided
                 meaningful predictions of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity.
                 Actionable alterations were found in 91 \% of patients (mean
                 4.9 per patient, including somatic mutations, copy number
                 alterations, gene expression alterations, and germline
                 variants), a 7.5-fold, 2.0-fold, and 1.9-fold increase over
                 what could have been uncovered by CHPv2, OCP, and
                 FoundationOne, respectively. The findings altered the course
                 of treatment in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
                 that a comprehensive, integrative genomic approach as outlined
                 above significantly enhanced genomics-based PCT strategies.",

                 alterations have been introduced into personalized cancer
                 medicine, but their effects can be modulated by the activities
                 of other genes or molecules. Previous studies aiming to
                 identify multiple molecular alterations for combination
                 therapies are limited by available data. Given the recent
                 large scale of available pharmacogenomic data, it is possible
                 to systematically identify multiple biomarkers that contribute
                 jointly to drug sensitivity, and to identify combination
                 therapies for personalized cancer medicine. In this study, we
                 used pharmacogenomic profiling data provided from two
                 independent cohorts in a systematic in silico investigation of
                 perturbed genes cooperatively associated with drug

                 the BRAF gene and upregulated expression of the PIM1 gene, was
                 experimentally validated to benefit from a therapy combining
                 BRAF inhibitor and PIM1 inhibitor in lung cancer. This study
                 demonstrates how pharmacogenomic data can be used to

  abstract    = "Disruption of gene regulation is known to play major roles in
                 carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Here, we
                 comprehensively characterize the mutational profiles of
                 diverse transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across
                 1,574 completely sequenced cancer genomes encompassing 11
                 tumour types. We assess the relative rates and impact of the
                 mutational burden at the binding sites of 81 transcription
                 factors (TFs), by comparing the abundance and patterns of
                 single base substitutions within putatively functional binding
                 sites to control sites with matched sequence composition.
                 There is a strong (1.43-fold) and significant excess of
                 mutations at functional binding sites across TFs, and the
                 mutations that accumulate in cancers are typically more
                 disruptive than variants tolerated in extant human populations
                 at the same sites. CTCF binding sites suffer an exceptionally
                 high mutational load in cancer (3.31-fold excess) relative to
                 control sites, and we demonstrate for the first time that this
                 effect is seen in essentially all cancer types with sufficient
                 data. The sub-set of CTCF sites involved in higher order
                 chromatin structures has the highest mutational burden,
                 suggesting a widespread breakdown of chromatin organization.
                 However, we find no evidence for selection driving these
                 distinctive patterns of mutation. The mutational load at
                 CTCF-binding sites is substantially determined by replication
                 timing and the mutational signature of the tumor in question,
                 suggesting that selectively neutral processes underlie the
                 unusual mutation patterns. Pervasive hyper-mutation within
                 transcription factor binding sites rewires the regulatory
                 landscape of the cancer genome, but it is dominated by
                 mutational processes rather than selection.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have reported
                 nearly 100 common germline susceptibility loci associated with
                 the risk for breast cancer. Tumour sequencing studies have
                 characterised somatic mutation profiles in breast cancer
                 patients. The relationship between breast cancer
                 susceptibility loci and somatic mutation patterns in breast
                 cancer remains largely unexplored. METHODS: We used
                 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array data and
                 tumour exome sequencing data available from 638 breast cancer
                 patients of European ancestry from The Cancer Genome Atlas
                 (TCGA) project. We analysed both genotype data and, when
                 necessary, imputed genotypes for 90 known breast cancer
                 susceptibility loci. We performed linear regression models to
                 investigate possible associations between germline risk
                 variants with total somatic mutation count (TSMC), as well as
                 specific mutation types. We examined individual SNP genotypes,
                 as well as a multi-SNP polygenic risk score (PRS). Models were
                 statistically adjusted for age at diagnosis, stage,
                 oestrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PR) status
                 of breast cancer. We also performed stratified analyses by ER
                 and PR status. RESULTS: We observed a significant inverse
                 association (P=8.75 \texttimes{} 10(-6); FDR=0.001) between
                 the risk allele in rs2588809 of the gene RAD51B and TSMC
                 across all breast cancer patients, for both ER(+) and ER(-)
                 tumours. This association was also evident for different types
                 of mutations. The PRS analysis for all patients, with or
                 without rs2588809, showed a significant inverse association
                 (P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively) with TSMC. This inverse
                 association was significant in ER(+) patients with the
                 ER(+)-specific PRS (P=0.02), but not among ER(-) patients for
                 the ER(-)-specific PRS (P=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: We observed an
                 inverse association between common germline risk variants and
                 TSMC, which, if confirmed, could provide new insights into how
                 germline variation informs our understanding of somatic
                 mutation patterns in breast cancer.British Journal of Cancer

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: Cancer genome characterization efforts now provide
                 an initial view of the somatic alterations in primary tumors.
                 However, most point mutations occur at low frequency, and the
                 function of these alleles remains undefined. We have developed
                 a scalable systematic approach to interrogate the function of
                 cancer-associated gene variants. We subjected 474 mutant
                 alleles curated from 5,338 tumors to pooled in vivo tumor
                 formation assays and gene expression profiling. We identified
                 12 transforming alleles, including two in genes (PIK3CB, POT1)
                 that have not been shown to be tumorigenic. One rare KRAS
                 allele, D33E, displayed tumorigenicity and constitutive
                 activation of known RAS effector pathways. By comparing gene
                 expression changes induced upon expression of wild-type and
                 mutant alleles, we inferred the activity of specific alleles.
                 Because alleles found to be mutated only once in 5,338 tumors
                 rendered cells tumorigenic, these observations underscore the
                 value of integrating genomic information with functional
                 studies. SIGNIFICANCE: Experimentally inferring the functional
                 status of cancer-associated mutations facilitates the
                 interpretation of genomic information in cancer. Pooled in
                 vivo screen and gene expression profiling identified
                 functional variants and demonstrated that expression of rare
                 variants induced tumorigenesis. Variant phenotyping through
                 functional studies will facilitate defining key somatic events

                 selective lethality in a tumor by exploiting interactions
                 between its driving mutations and specific drug targets. Here
                 we use a multi-species approach to develop a resource of
                 synthetic lethal interactions relevant to cancer therapy.
                 First, we screen in yeast ∼169,000 potential interactions
                 among orthologs of human tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and
                 genes encoding drug targets across multiple genotoxic
                 environments. Guided by the strongest signal, we evaluate
                 thousands of TSG-drug combinations in HeLa cells, resulting in
                 networks of conserved synthetic lethal interactions. Analysis
                 of these networks reveals that interaction stability across
                 environments and shared gene function increase the likelihood
                 of observing an interaction in human cancer cells. Using these
                 rules, we prioritize ∼10(5) human TSG-drug combinations for
                 future follow-up. We validate interactions based on cell

                 melanoma and NSCLC. An additional independent set of 613
                 tumors drawn from 5 cancers were analyzed for replication. An
                 analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves of
                 published data on checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma
                 and NSCLC data estimates a cutoff of 192 NsM with 74\%
                 sensitivity and 59.3\% specificity to discriminate potential
                 clinical benefit. Across the 7,757 samples of TCGA, 16.2\%
                 displayed an NsM count that exceeded the threshold of 192. It
                 is notable that more than 30\% of bladder, colon, gastric, and
                 endometrial cancers have NsM counts above 192, which was also
                 confirmed in melanoma and NSCLC. Our data could inform the

                 in mammalian genomes. It is widely accepted that genome-wide
                 CpG depletion is predominantly caused by an elevated CpG > TpG
                 mutation rate due to frequent cytosine methylation in the CpG
                 context. Meanwhile the CpG content in genomic regions called
                 CpG islands (CGIs) is noticeably higher. This observation is
                 usually explained by lower CpG > TpG substitution rates within
                 CGIs due to reduced cytosine methylation levels. RESULTS: By
                 combining genome-wide data on substitutions and methylation
                 levels in several human cell types we have shown that cytosine
                 methylation in human sperm cells was strongly and consistently
                 associated with increased CpG > TpG substitution rates. In
                 contrast, this correlation was not observed for embryonic stem
                 cells or fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the decreased sperm CpG
                 methylation level was insufficient to explain the reduced CpG
                 > TpG substitution rates in CGIs. CONCLUSIONS: While cytosine
                 methylation in human sperm cells is strongly associated with
                 increased CpG > TpG substitution rates, substitution rates are
                 significantly reduced within CGIs even after sperm CpG
                 methylation levels and local GC content are controlled for.
                 Our findings are consistent with strong negative selection
                 preserving methylated CpGs within CGIs including intergenic

                 array of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Often, these
                 changes underlie cancer development, progression, and drug
                 resistance, so the utility of model systems rests on their
                 ability to recapitulate the genomic aberrations observed in
                 primary tumors. Tumor-derived cell lines have long been used
                 to study the underlying biologic processes in cancer, as well
                 as screening platforms for discovering and evaluating the
                 efficacy of anticancer therapeutics. Multiple -omic
                 measurements across more than a thousand cancer cell lines
                 have been produced following advances in high-throughput
                 technologies and multigroup collaborative projects. These data
                 complement the large, international cancer genomic sequencing
                 efforts to characterize patient tumors, such as The Cancer
                 Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium
                 (ICGC). Given the scope and scale of data that have been
                 generated, researchers are now in a position to evaluate the
                 similarities and differences that exist in genomic features
                 between cell lines and patient samples. As pharmacogenomics
                 models, cell lines offer the advantages of being easily grown,
                 relatively inexpensive, and amenable to high-throughput
                 testing of therapeutic agents. Data generated from cell lines
                 can then be used to link cellular drug response to genomic
                 features, where the ultimate goal is to build predictive
                 signatures of patient outcome. This review highlights the
                 recent work that has compared -omic profiles of cell lines
                 with primary tumors, and discusses the advantages and

              that particular program. This precludes investigators who have

              comprehensive landscape of the associations between mutation
              features and expression profile in multiple cancer types,
              including 62 genes showing mutation type associated expression
              changes, 21 genes showing mutation cluster associations and 51
              genes showing mutation status associations. We revealed four
              characteristics of the patterns that mutations impact on
              expression. First, we showed that mutation type (truncation
              versus amino acid-altering mutations) was the most important
              determinant of expression levels. Second, we detected mutation
              clusters in well-studied oncogenes that were associated with gene
              expression. Third, we found both similarities and differences in
              association patterns existed within and across cancer types.
              Fourth, although many of the observed associations stay stable at
              both mRNA and protein expression levels, there are also novel
              associations uniquely observed at the protein level, which
              warrant future investigation. Taken together, our findings
              provided implications for cancer driver gene prioritization and
              insights into the functional consequences of somatic mutations.",

                 therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs. Systems pharmacology
                 analyses rely on experimental ``omics'' technologies that are
                 capable of measuring changes in large numbers of variables,
                 often at a genome-wide level, to build networks for analyzing
                 drug action. A major use of omics technologies is to relate
                 the genomic status of an individual to the therapeutic
                 efficacy of a drug of interest. Combining pathway and network
                 analyses, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models, and a

                 required to identify the target proteins associated with the
                 phenotype. METHODS: In this study, we propose a new method to
                 predict target proteins of drug candidate compounds based on
                 drug-induced gene expression data in Connectivity Map and a
                 machine learning classification technique, which we call the
                 ``transcriptomic approach.'' RESULTS: Unlike existing methods
                 such as the chemogenomic approach, the transcriptomic approach
                 enabled the prediction of target proteins without dependence
                 on prior knowledge of compound chemical structures. The
                 prediction accuracy of the chemogenomic approach was highly

                 limited attempt have been made to predict the anticancer
                 activity of a diverse class of chemicals against a wide
                 variety of cancer cell lines. In this study, we described a
                 hybrid method developed on thousands of anticancer and
                 non-anticancer molecules tested against National Cancer
                 Institute (NCI) 60 cancer cell lines. RESULTS: Our analysis of
                 anticancer molecules revealed that majority of anticancer
                 molecules contains 18-24 carbon atoms and are dominated by
                 functional groups like R2NH, R3N, ROH, RCOR, and ROR. It was
                 also observed that certain substructures (e.g.,
                 1-methoxy-4-methylbenzene, 1-methoxy benzene, Nitrobenzene,
                 Indole, Propenyl benzene) are more abundant in anticancer
                 molecules. Next, we developed anticancer molecule prediction
                 models using various machine-learning techniques and achieved
                 maximum matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.81 with
                 90.40\% accuracy using support vector machine (SVM) based
                 models. In another approach, a novel similarity or potency
                 score based method has been developed using selected
                 fragments/fingerprints and achieved maximum MCC of 0.82 with
                 90.65\% accuracy. Finally, we combined the strength of above
                 methods and developed a hybrid method with maximum MCC of 0.85
                 with 92.47\% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a hybrid

                 only benefit a defined subset of patients. Predicting the best
                 treatment strategy hinges on our ability to effectively
                 translate genomic data into actionable information on drug
                 responses. RESULTS: To achieve this goal, we compiled a
                 comprehensive collection of baseline cancer genome data and
                 drug response information derived from a large panel of cancer
                 cell lines. This data set was applied to identify the
                 signature genes relevant to drug sensitivity and their
                 resistance by integrating CNVs and the gene expression of cell
                 lines with in vitro drug responses. We presented an efficient
                 in-silico pipeline for integrating heterogeneous cell line
                 data sources with the simultaneous modeling of drug response
                 values across all the drugs and cell lines. Potential
                 signature genes correlated with drug response (sensitive or
                 resistant) in different cancer types were identified. Using
                 signature genes, our collaborative filtering-based drug
                 response prediction model outperformed the 44 algorithms
                 submitted to the DREAM competition on breast cancer cells. The
                 functions of the identified drug response related signature
                 genes were carefully analyzed at the pathway level and the
                 synthetic lethality level. Furthermore, we validated these
                 signature genes by applying them to the classification of the
                 different subtypes of the TCGA tumor samples, and further
                 uncovered their in vivo implications using clinical patient
                 data. CONCLUSIONS: Our work may have promise in translating
                 genomic data into customized marker genes relevant to the
                 response of specific drugs for a specific cancer type of
                 individual patients.",

                 lines, whereas certain drugs are effective against only a
                 limited type of cell lines. Tissue-specific preference of

                 cell lines belonging to a specific tissue. Genomic features

                 drugs is an important challenge for realizing precision
                 medicine for cancer. Many studies have analyzed the
                 comprehensive anticancer drug-response profiles and genomic
                 profiles of cancer cell lines to identify the relationship
                 between the anticancer drug response and genomic alternations.
                 However, few studies have focused on interpreting these

                 genomic alterations in cancer cell lines by considering which
                 interactions in the signaling pathway were perturbed by
                 mutations. With our interaction-centric approach, we

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: The underlying relationship between genomic
                 factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains
                 unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous
                 responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly
                 associated with their specific changes in gene expression and
                 somatic alterations. The emerging large-scale pharmacogenomic
                 data provide us valuable opportunities to improve existing
                 therapies or to guide early-phase clinical trials of compounds
                 under development. However, how to identify the underlying
                 combinatorial patterns among pharmacogenomics data are still a
                 challenging issue. RESULTS: In this study, we adopted a sparse
                 network-regularized partial least square (SNPLS) method to
                 identify joint modular patterns using large-scale pairwise
                 gene-expression and drug-response data. We incorporated a
                 molecular network to the (sparse) partial least square model
                 to improve the module accuracy via a network-based penalty. We
                 first demonstrated the effectiveness of SNPLS using a set of
                 simulation data and compared it with two typical methods.
                 Further, we applied it to gene expression profiles for 13 321
                 genes and pharmacological profiles for 98 anticancer drugs
                 across 641 cancer cell lines consisting of diverse types of
                 human cancers. We identified 20 gene-drug co-modules, each of
                 which consists of 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on
                 average. The majority of identified co-modules have
                 significantly functional implications and coordinated
                 gene-drug associations. The modular analysis here provided us
                 new insights into the molecular mechanisms of how drugs act

                 during preclinical development hinders predictions of clinical
                 efficacy and identifying factors that underlie heterogeneous
                 patient responses for patient-selection strategies. We
                 established ∼1,000 patient-derived tumor xenograft models
                 (PDXs) with a diverse set of driver mutations. With these
                 PDXs, we performed in vivo compound screens using a 1
                 \texttimes{} 1 \texttimes{} 1 experimental design (PDX
                 clinical trial or PCT) to assess the population responses to
                 62 treatments across six indications. We demonstrate both the
                 reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this
                 approach by identifying associations between a genotype and
                 drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In
                 addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more
                 accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the
                 clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities. We
                 therefore propose that this experimental paradigm could
                 potentially improve preclinical evaluation of treatment
                 modalities and enhance our ability to predict clinical trial

                 prognosis due to the two hallmarks of 1) being metastatic with
                 2) no known specific treatment. An organ-labeled diagnosis of
                 cancer should therefore be sought. In this study, we have
                 analyzed population-based incidence and survival data of CUP
                 over the latest 40 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Complete
                 national data on 23 004 CUP-patients from the Cancer Registry
                 of Norway sampled from 1971 to 2010 are presented, with
                 absolute and age-adjusted incidence rates correlated to the
                 total cancer incidence. One-year relative survival rates were
                 calculated. RESULTS: The incidence of CUP increased both in
                 absolute numbers and as a fraction of total cancer incidence
                 during the first half of the period. There has been a
                 substantial decrease in incidence over the latest 20 years,
                 now being responsible of only 1.7\% and 1.2\% of the total
                 cancer incidence in females and males, respectively, with an
                 age-adjusted incidence rate of 3.5 and 3.8, respectively. The
                 one-year relative survival rate has increased and was slightly
                 below 20\% for both sexes in 2010. CONCLUSION: Better
                 diagnostics, both radiological and pathological, is probably
                 responsible for a substantially lower incidence. Improved
                 treatment for cancers in general also benefits the CUP-group.",

                 remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by
                 robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic
                 diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and
                 pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the

                 expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel
                 sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled
                 with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across
                 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification
                 of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of

                 meaningful clustering to be performed for genomic tracks using
                 standard clustering algorithms. An implementation of the
                 methodology is provided through a tool, ClusTrack, which
                 allows fine-tuned clustering analyses to be specified through
                 a web-based interface. We apply our methods to the clustering
                 of occupancy of the H3K4me1 histone modification in samples
                 from a range of different cell types. The majority of samples
                 form meaningful subclusters, confirming that the definitions
                 of features and similarity capture biological, rather than
                 technical, variation between the genomic tracks. Input data
                 and results are available, and can be reproduced, through a

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Genomic mutations caused by cytotoxic agents used
                 in cancer chemotherapy may cause secondary malignancies as
                 well as contribute to the evolution of treatment-resistant
                 tumour cells. The stable diploid genome of the chicken DT40
                 lymphoblast cell line, an established DNA repair model system,
                 is well suited to accurately assay genomic mutations. RESULTS:
                 We use whole genome sequencing of multiple DT40 clones to
                 determine the mutagenic effect of eight common cytotoxics used
                 for the treatment of millions of patients worldwide. We
                 determine the spontaneous mutagenesis rate at 2.3 \texttimes{}
                 10(-10) per base per cell division and find that cisplatin,
                 cyclophosphamide and etoposide induce extra base substitutions
                 with distinct spectra. After four cycles of exposure,
                 cisplatin induces 0.8 mutations per Mb, equivalent to the
                 median mutational burden in common leukaemias.
                 Cisplatin-induced mutations, including short insertions and
                 deletions, are mainly located at sites of putative intrastrand
                 crosslinks. We find two of the newly defined
                 cisplatin-specific mutation types as causes of the reversion
                 of BRCA2 mutations in emerging cisplatin-resistant tumours or
                 cell clones. Gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea,
                 doxorubicin and paclitaxel have no measurable mutagenic
                 effect. The cisplatin-induced mutation spectrum shows good
                 correlation with cancer mutation signatures attributed to
                 smoking and other sources of guanine-directed base damage.
                 CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the use of cell
                 line mutagenesis assays to validate or predict the mutagenic
                 effect of environmental and iatrogenic exposures. Our results
                 suggest genetic reversion due to cisplatin-induced mutations
                 as a distinct mechanism for developing resistance.",

                 is regarded as a determining event in cervical carcinogenesis.
                 However, the exact mechanism for integration, and the role of
                 integration in stimulating cancer progression, is not fully
                 characterized. Although integration sites are reported to
                 appear randomly distributed over all chromosomes, fragile
                 sites, translocation break points and transcriptionally active
                 regions have all been suggested as being preferred sites for
                 integration. In addition, more recent studies have reported
                 integration events occurring within or surrounding essential
                 cancer-related genes, raising the question whether these may
                 reflect key events in the molecular genesis of HPV induced
                 carcinomas. In a search for possible common denominators of
                 the integration sites, we utilized the chromosomal coordinates
                 of 121 viral-cellular fusion transcripts, and examined for
                 statistical overrepresentation of integration sites with
                 various features of ENCODE chromatin information data, using
                 the Genomic HyperBrowser. We find that integration sites
                 coincide with DNA that is transcriptionally active in mucosal
                 epithelium, as judged by the relationship of integration sites
                 to DNase hypersensitivity and H3K4me3 methylation data.
                 Finding an association between integration and transcription
                 is highly informative with regard to the spatio-temporal
                 characteristics of the integration process. These results
                 suggest that integration is an early event in carcinogenesis,
                 more than a late product of chromosomal instability. If the
                 viral integrations were more likely to occur in destabilized
                 regions of the DNA, a completely random distribution of the
                 integration sites would be expected. As a by-product of
                 integration in actively transcribing DNA, a tendency of
                 integration in or close to genes is likely to be observed.
                 This increases the possibility of viral signals to modulate
                 the expression of these genes, potentially contributing to the
                 progression towards cancer.",

                 the cell types in which these variants are active. We used
                 available data on MS-associated single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms (SNPs) and deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive
                 sites (DHSs) from 112 different cell types. Genomic intervals

                 SNPs was assessed using the software GRAIL (Gene Relationships

                 regions with suggestive association with MS and additional
                 immune-mediated traits were investigated. Several new
                 candidate MS-associated genes located within regions of

                 data indicate that Th1, Th17, cytotoxic T, B and NK cells play
                 a prominent role in the etiology of MS. Regions with confirmed
                 and suggestive association have a similar immunological
                 profile, indicating that many SNPs truly influencing the risk
                 of MS actually fail to reach genome-wide significance.

                 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase are
                 promising and show high response rates in the subset of
                 patients with activating mutations in EGFR. The frequency of
                 these mutations is largely unknown in unselected Caucasian
                 patients. METHODS: Mutation analysis of EGFR exons 18-21 was
                 performed on 240 lung cancer samples using the TheraScreen
                 EGFR mutation kit and denaturing high-performance liquid
                 chromatography in addition to sequencing. RESULTS: In a cohort
                 of 240 Norwegian lung cancer patients selected for surgery, we
                 identified 18 tumors with EGFR-activating mutations (7.5\%, 14
                 women and 4 men), of which 14 were adenocarcinomas, 2 squamous
                 cell carcinomas, and 2 bronchoalveolar carcinomas. Five of the
                 mutations were found in patients with more than 20 pack-years
                 of smoking history. CONCLUSION: The frequency of EGFR
                 mutations is lower in our cohort than among Asian lung cancer

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The severity of cancers is often measured in
                 number of deaths. However, number of years of life lost (YLL)
                 may be a more appropriate indicator of impact on society. Here
                 we have calculated the YLL of adult cancers in Norway for the
                 year 2012, as well as for the previous 15-year period.
                 METHODS: Data on age composition, expected remaining years of
                 life, total numbers of deaths and deaths due to cancer were
                 retrieved from the National Census Agency Statistics Norway.
                 YLL were calculated for both sexes aged 25-99 years based on
                 each individual's age at death, and the expected remaining
                 years of life at that age. RESULTS: Cancer deaths represented
                 25.8\% of all adult deaths in 2012, with a lower fraction of
                 females (28.7\% in men and 23.1\% in women), whereas cancer
                 represented 35.2\% of all YLL, with a higher fraction of
                 females (32.8\% in men and 37.8\% in women). Females loose on
                 average more life years to cancer than men (14.9 vs 12.7
                 years). Average YLL varied from 23.7 (cervical cancer) to 7.9
                 (prostate cancer). Lung cancer caused almost as many YLL alone
                 (22.1\% of cancer-caused YLL) as colon, prostate and breast
                 cancer combined (23.1\%). From 1997 to 2012, cancer-caused YLL
                 as a fraction of all YLL increased from 32.5\% to 35.2\%, but
                 with major differences among diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer is
                 a major and increasing cause of premature deaths, and YLL may
                 be a more accurate measure than number of deaths. Public
                 health efforts and research funding should be explicitly
                 directed at preventing premature deaths.",

                 various high-throughput sequencing technologies, data on many
                 molecular aspects, such as gene regulation, chromatin
                 dynamics, and the three-dimensional organization of DNA, are
                 rapidly being generated in an increasing number of
                 laboratories. The variation in biological context, and the
                 increasingly dispersed mode of data generation, imply a need
                 for precise, interoperable and flexible representations of
                 genomic features through formats that are easy to parse. A
                 host of alternative formats are currently available and in
                 use, complicating analysis and tool development. The issue of
                 whether and how the multitude of formats reflects varying
                 underlying characteristics of data has to our knowledge not
                 previously been systematically treated. RESULTS: We here
                 identify intrinsic distinctions between genomic features, and
                 argue that the distinctions imply that a certain variation in
                 the representation of features as genomic tracks is warranted.
                 Four core informational properties of tracks are discussed:
                 gaps, lengths, values and interconnections. From this we
                 delineate fifteen generic track types. Based on the track type
                 distinctions, we characterize major existing representational
                 formats and find that the track types are not adequately
                 supported by any single format. We also find, in contrast to
                 the XML formats, that none of the existing tabular formats are
                 conveniently extendable to support all track types. We thus
                 propose two unified formats for track data, an improved XML
                 format, BioXSD 1.1, and a new tabular format, GTrack 1.0.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The defined track types are shown to capture
                 relevant distinctions between genomic annotation tracks,
                 resulting in varying representational needs and analysis
                 possibilities. The proposed formats, GTrack 1.0 and BioXSD
                 1.1, cater to the identified track distinctions and emphasize
                 preciseness, flexibility and parsing convenience.",

                 certain types of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.
                 Recently, a mutational signature was associated with failure
                 of double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination
                 based on its high mutational burden in samples harbouring

                 a high degree of inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral variability.
                 Individual tumors have unique profiles, and these molecular
                 signatures make the use of traditional histology-based
                 treatments problematic. The conventional diagnostic
                 categories, while necessary for care, thwart the use of
                 molecular information for treatment as molecular
                 characteristics cross tissue types.This is compounded by the
                 struggle to keep abreast the scientific advances made in all
                 fields of science, and by the enormous challenge to organize,
                 cross-reference, and apply molecular data for patient benefit.
                 In order to supplement the site-specific, histology-driven
                 diagnosis with genomic, proteomic and metabolomics
                 information, a paradigm shift in diagnosis and treatment of
                 patients is required.While most physicians are open and keen
                 to use the emerging data for therapy, even those versed in
                 molecular therapeutics are overwhelmed with the amount of
                 available data. It is not surprising that even though The
                 Human Genome Project was completed thirteen years ago, our
                 patients have not benefited from the information. Physicians
                 cannot, and should not be asked to process the gigabytes of
                 genomic and proteomic information on their own in order to

                 gene encoding the serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF)
                 in the majority of melanomas offers an opportunity to test
                 oncogene-targeted therapy for this disease. METHODS: We
                 conducted a multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation trial of
                 PLX4032 (also known as RG7204), an orally available inhibitor
                 of mutated BRAF, followed by an extension phase involving the
                 maximum dose that could be administered without adverse
                 effects (the recommended phase 2 dose). Patients received
                 PLX4032 twice daily until they had disease progression.
                 Pharmacokinetic analysis and tumor-response assessments were
                 conducted in all patients. In selected patients, tumor biopsy
                 was performed before and during treatment to validate BRAF
                 inhibition. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients (49 of whom had
                 melanoma) were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase, and 32
                 additional patients with metastatic melanoma who had BRAF with
                 the V600E mutation were enrolled in the extension phase. The
                 recommended phase 2 dose was 960 mg twice daily, with
                 increases in the dose limited by grade 2 or 3 rash, fatigue,
                 and arthralgia. In the dose-escalation cohort, among the 16
                 patients with melanoma whose tumors carried the V600E BRAF
                 mutation and who were receiving 240 mg or more of PLX4032
                 twice daily, 10 had a partial response and 1 had a complete
                 response. Among the 32 patients in the extension cohort, 24
                 had a partial response and 2 had a complete response. The
                 estimated median progression-free survival among all patients
                 was more than 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of metastatic
                 melanoma with PLX4032 in patients with tumors that carry the
                 V600E BRAF mutation resulted in complete or partial tumor

                 critical genes that alter normal programmes of cell
                 proliferation, differentiation and death. As the first stage
                 of a systematic genome-wide screen for these genes, we have
                 prioritized for analysis signalling pathways in which at least
                 one gene is mutated in human cancer. The RAS RAF MEK ERK MAP
                 kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals.
                 RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in about 15\% of human
                 cancer. The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic
                 serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS.
                 Here we report BRAF somatic missense mutations in 66\% of
                 malignant melanomas and at lower frequency in a wide range of
                 human cancers. All mutations are within the kinase domain,
                 with a single substitution (V599E) accounting for 80\%.
                 Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase activity and are
                 transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS function is not
                 required for the growth of cancer cell lines with the V599E
                 mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is

                 kinase that causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Since
                 tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the transforming
                 function of BCR-ABL, an inhibitor of the kinase could be an
                 effective treatment for CML. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1,
                 dose-escalating trial of STI571 (formerly known as CGP
                 57148B), a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase.
                 STI571 was administered orally to 83 patients with CML in the
                 chronic phase in whom treatment with interferon alfa had
                 failed. Patients were successively assigned to 1 of 14 doses
                 ranging from 25 to 1000 mg per day. RESULTS: Adverse effects
                 of STI571 were minimal; the most common were nausea, myalgias,
                 edema, and diarrhea. A maximal tolerated dose was not
                 identified. Complete hematologic responses were observed in 53
                 of 54 patients treated with daily doses of 300 mg or more and
                 typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy. Of the
                 54 patients treated with doses of 300 mg or more, cytogenetic
                 responses occurred in 29, including 17 (31 percent of the 54
                 patients who received this dose) with major responses (0 to 35
                 percent of cells in metaphase positive for the Philadelphia
                 chromosome); 7 of these patients had complete cytogenetic
                 remissions. CONCLUSIONS: STI571 is well tolerated and has
                 significant antileukemic activity in patients with CML in whom
                 treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Our results provide
                 evidence of the essential role of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase
                 activity in CML and demonstrate the potential for the
                 development of anticancer drugs based on the specific
                 molecular abnormality present in a human cancer.",

                 adapted medical care based on the genetic characteristics of
                 each patient and his/her tumor. The last decade witnessed the
                 development of high-throughput technologies such as
                 microarrays and next-generation sequencing which paved the way
                 to PM in the field of oncology. While the cost of these
                 technologies decreases, we are facing an exponential increase
                 in the amount of data produced. Our ability to use this
                 information in daily practice relies strongly on the
                 availability of an efficient bioinformatics system that
                 assists in the translation of knowledge from the bench towards
                 molecular targeting and diagnosis. Clinical trials and routine
                 diagnoses constitute different approaches, both requiring a
                 strong bioinformatics environment capable of (i) warranting
                 the integration and the traceability of data, (ii) ensuring
                 the correct processing and analyses of genomic data, and (iii)
                 applying well-defined and reproducible procedures for workflow
                 management and decision-making. To address the issues, a
                 seamless information system was developed at Institut Curie
                 which facilitates the data integration and tracks in real-time
                 the processing of individual samples. Moreover, computational
                 pipelines were developed to identify reliably genomic

                 (NCT01827384) being conducted in the National Institutes of
                 Health (NIH) Clinical Center. This trial is one of the first
                 to use a randomized design to examine whether assigning
                 treatment based on genomic tumor screening can improve the
                 rate and duration of response in patients with advanced solid
                 tumors. An analytically validated next-generation sequencing
                 (NGS) assay is applied to DNA from patients' tumors to
                 identify mutations in a panel of genes that are thought likely
                 to affect the utility of targeted therapies available for use
                 in the clinical trial. The patients are randomized to a
                 treatment selected to target a somatic mutation in the tumor
                 or with a control treatment. The GeneMed system streamlines
                 the workflow of the clinical trial and serves as a
                 communications hub among the sequencing lab, the treatment
                 selection team, and clinical personnel. It automates the
                 annotation of the genomic variants identified by sequencing,
                 predicts the functional impact of mutations, identifies the
                 actionable mutations, and facilitates quality control by the
                 molecular characterization lab in the review of variants. The
                 GeneMed system collects baseline information about the
                 patients from the clinic team to determine eligibility for the
                 panel of drugs available. The system performs randomized
                 treatment assignments under the oversight of a supervising
                 treatment selection team and generates a patient report
                 containing detected genomic alterations. NCI is planning to
                 expand the MPACT trial to multiple cancer centers soon. In

                 major goal in modern oncology that should ultimately lead to a
                 personalised treatment. High-throughput screenings of
                 potentially active compounds against a panel of genomically
                 heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple
                 relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses.
                 Various computational approaches have been proposed to predict
                 sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used
                 the chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their
                 effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary
                 approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict
                 the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment,
                 quantified through IC₅₀ values, based on both the genomic
                 features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the
                 considered drugs. Models predicted IC₅₀ values in a 8-fold
                 cross-validation and an independent blind test with
                 coefficient of determination R² of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively.
                 Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable
                 accuracy (R² of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not
                 used in the training stage. Our in silico models can be used
                 to optimise the experimental design of drug-cell screenings by
                 estimating a large proportion of missing IC₅₀ values rather
                 than experimentally measuring them. The implications of our
                 results go beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially
                 thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically
                 test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on
                 their structure, thus providing a computational framework to
                 identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as
                 ultimately be useful for personalized medicine by linking the

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: An enduring challenge in personalized medicine
                 lies in selecting the right drug for each individual patient.
                 While testing of drugs on patients in large trials is the only
                 way to assess their clinical efficacy and toxicity, we
                 dramatically lack resources to test the hundreds of drugs
                 currently under development. Therefore the use of preclinical
                 model systems has been intensively investigated as this
                 approach enables response to hundreds of drugs to be tested in
                 multiple cell lines in parallel. METHODS: Two large-scale
                 pharmacogenomic studies recently screened multiple anticancer
                 drugs on over 1000 cell lines. We propose to combine these
                 datasets to build and robustly validate genomic predictors of
                 drug response. We compared five different approaches for
                 building predictors of increasing complexity. We assessed
                 their performance in cross-validation and in two large
                 validation sets, one containing the same cell lines present in
                 the training set and another dataset composed of cell lines
                 that have never been used during the training phase. RESULTS:
                 Sixteen drugs were found in common between the datasets. We
                 were able to validate multivariate predictors for three out of
                 the 16 tested drugs, namely irinotecan, PD-0325901, and
                 PLX4720. Moreover, we observed that response to 17-AAG, an
                 inhibitor of Hsp90, could be efficiently predicted by the
                 expression level of a single gene, NQO1. CONCLUSION: These
                 results suggest that genomic predictors could be robustly
                 validated for specific drugs. If successfully validated in
                 patients' tumor cells, and subsequently in clinical trials,
                 they could act as companion tests for the corresponding drugs
                 and play an important role in personalized medicine.",

  abstract = "Cancer patients often show heterogeneous drug responses such that
              only a small subset of patients is sensitive to a given
              anticancer drug. With the availability of large-scale genomic
              profiling via next-generation sequencing, it is now economically
              feasible to profile the whole transcriptome and genome of
              individual patients in order to identify their unique genetic
              mutations and differentially expressed genes, which are believed
              to be responsible for heterogeneous drug responses. Although
              subtyping analysis has identified patient subgroups sharing
              common biomarkers, there is no effective method to predict the
              drug response of individual patients precisely and reliably.
              Herein, we propose a novel computational algorithm to predict the
              drug response of individual patients based on personal genomic
              profiles, as well as pharmacogenomic and drug sensitivity data.
              Specifically, more than 600 cancer cell lines (viewed as
              individual patients) across over 50 types of cancers and their
              responses to 75 drugs were obtained from the genomics of drug
              sensitivity in cancer database. The drug-specific sensitivity
              signatures were determined from the changes in genomic profiles
              of individual cell lines in response to a specific drug. The
              optimal drugs for individual cell lines were predicted by
              integrating the votes from other cell lines. The experimental
              results show that the proposed drug prediction algorithm can be
              used to improve greatly the reliability of finding optimal drugs
              for individual patients and will, thus, form a key component in
              the precision medicine infrastructure for oncology care.",

                 question in these analyses is the extent to which these
                 methods identify clinically actionable alterations and whether
                 the examination of the tumor tissue alone is sufficient or
                 whether matched normal DNA should also be analyzed to
                 accurately identify tumor-specific (somatic) alterations. To
                 address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated 815
                 tumor-normal paired samples from patients of 15 tumor types.
                 We identified genomic alterations using next-generation
                 sequencing of whole exomes or 111 targeted genes that were
                 validated with sensitivities >95\% and >99\%, respectively,
                 and specificities >99.99\%. These analyses revealed an average
                 of 140 and 4.3 somatic mutations per exome and targeted
                 analysis, respectively. More than 75\% of cases had somatic
                 alterations in genes associated with known therapies or
                 current clinical trials. Analyses of matched normal DNA
                 identified germline alterations in cancer-predisposing genes
                 in 3\% of patients with apparently sporadic cancers. In
                 contrast, a tumor-only sequencing approach could not

                 genes and led to additional false-positive findings comprising

                 analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable
                 genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing

              proactive and predictive approach to medicine, where the emphasis
              is on disease prevention rather than the treatment of symptoms.
              The individualization of treatment for each patient will be at
              the centre of this approach, with all of a patient's medical data
              being computationally integrated and accessible. Precision
              medicine is being rapidly embraced by biomedical researchers,
              pioneering clinicians and scientific funding programmes in both
              the European Union (EU) and USA. Precision medicine is a key
              component of both Horizon 2020 (the EU Framework Programme for
              Research and Innovation) and the White House's Precision Medicine

                 bioinformatics platform that uses cloud computing and other
                 advanced computational tools to handle a variety of biomedical
                 BIG DATA including gene expression arrays, NGS and medical
                 images so that they can be analyzed in the full context of
                 other omics and clinical information. RESULTS: G-DOC Plus
                 currently holds data from over 10,000 patients selected from
                 private and public resources including Gene Expression Omnibus
                 (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the recently added
                 datasets from REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa
                 (REMBRANDT), caArray studies of lung and colon cancer, ImmPort
                 and the 1000 genomes data sets. The system allows researchers
                 to explore clinical-omic data one sample at a time, as a
                 cohort of samples; or at the level of population, providing
                 the user with a comprehensive view of the data. G-DOC Plus
                 tools have been leveraged in cancer and non-cancer studies for
                 hypothesis generation and validation; biomarker discovery and
                 multi-omics analysis, to explore somatic mutations and cancer
                 MRI images; as well as for training and graduate education in
                 bioinformatics, data and computational sciences. Several of
                 these use cases are described in this paper to demonstrate its
                 multifaceted usability. CONCLUSION: G-DOC Plus can be used to
                 support a variety of user groups in multiple domains to enable
                 hypothesis generation for precision medicine research. The
                 long-term vision of G-DOC Plus is to extend this translational
                 bioinformatics platform to stay current with emerging omics
                 technologies and analysis methods to continue supporting novel
                 hypothesis generation, analysis and validation for integrative
                 biomedical research. By integrating several aspects of the
                 disease and exposing various data elements, such as outpatient
                 lab workup, pathology, radiology, current treatments,
                 molecular signatures and expected outcomes over a web
                 interface, G-DOC Plus will continue to strengthen precision

  abstract    = "Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the
                 uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells and oncology
                 is a branch of medicine that deals with tumors. The last
                 decade has seen significant advances in the development of
                 biomarkers in oncology that play a critical role in
                 understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms which drive
                 tumor initiation, maintenance and progression. Clinical
                 molecular diagnostics and biomarker discoveries in oncology
                 are advancing rapidly as we begin to understand the complex
                 mechanisms that transform a normal cell into an abnormal one.
                 These discoveries have fueled the development of novel drug
                 targets and new treatment strategies. The standard of care for
                 patients with advanced-stage cancers has shifted away from an
                 empirical treatment strategy based on the
                 clinical-pathological profile to one where a biomarker driven
                 treatment algorithm based on the molecular profile of the
                 tumor is used. Recent advances in multiplex genotyping
                 technologies and high-throughput genomic profiling by
                 next-generation sequencing make possible the rapid and
                 comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome of individual
                 patients even from very little tumor biopsy material.
                 Predictive (diagnostic) biomarkers are helpful in matching
                 targeted therapies with patients and in preventing toxicity of
                 standard (systemic) therapies. Prognostic biomarkers identify
                 somatic germ line mutations, changes in DNA methylation,
                 elevated levels of microRNA (miRNA) and circulating tumor
                 cells (CTC) in blood. Predictive biomarkers using molecular
                 diagnostics are currently in use in clinical practice of
                 personalized oncotherapy for the treatment of five diseases:
                 chronic myeloid leukemia, colon, breast, lung cancer and
                 melanoma and these biomarkers are being used successfully to
                 evaluate benefits that can be achieved through targeted
                 therapy. Examples of these molecularly targeted biomarker
                 therapies are: tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid
                 leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors; anaplastic lymphoma
                 kinase (ALK) inhibitors in lung cancer with EML4-ALk fusion;
                 HER2/neu blockage in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer; and
                 epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) inhibition in
                 EGFR-mutated lung cancer. This review presents the current
                 state of our knowledge of biomarkers in five selected cancers:
                 chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal cancer, breast cancer,
                 non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.",

                 became the springboard for developing drugs aimed at molecular
                 targets deemed crucial to tumours. As this development
                 unfolded, a revolution in the speed and cost of genetic
                 sequencing occurred. The result-an armamentarium of drugs and
                 an array of molecular targets-set the stage for precision
                 oncology, a hypothesis that cancer treatment could be markedly
                 improved if therapies were guided by a tumour's genomic
                 alterations. Drawing lessons from the biological basis of
                 cancer and recent empirical investigations, we take a more
                 measured view of precision oncology's promise. Ultimately, the
                 promise is not our concern, but the threshold at which we
                 declare success. We review reports of precision oncology
                 alongside those of precision diagnostics and novel
                 radiotherapy approaches. Although confirmatory evidence is
                 scarce, these interventions have been widely endorsed. We
                 conclude that the current path will probably not be successful
                 or, at a minimum, will have to undergo substantive adjustments
                 before it can be successful. For the sake of patients with
                 cancer, we hope one form of precision oncology will deliver on
                 its promise. However, until confirmatory studies are
                 completed, precision oncology remains unproven, and as such, a

  abstract    = "Rapidly improving understanding of molecular oncology,
                 emerging novel therapeutics, and increasingly available and
                 affordable next-generation sequencing have created an
                 opportunity for delivering genomically informed personalized
                 cancer therapy. However, to implement genomically informed
                 therapy requires that a clinician interpret the patient's
                 molecular profile, including molecular characterization of the
                 tumor and the patient's germline DNA. In this Commentary, we
                 review existing data and tools for precision oncology and
                 present a framework for reviewing the available biomedical
                 literature on therapeutic implications of genomic alterations.
                 Genomic alterations, including mutations,
                 insertions/deletions, fusions, and copy number changes, need
                 to be curated in terms of the likelihood that they alter the
                 function of a ``cancer gene'' at the level of a specific
                 variant in order to discriminate so-called ``drivers'' from
                 ``passengers.'' Alterations that are targetable either
                 directly or indirectly with approved or investigational
                 therapies are potentially ``actionable.'' At this time,
                 evidence linking predictive biomarkers to therapies is strong
                 for only a few genomic markers in the context of specific
                 cancer types. For these genomic alterations in other diseases
                 and for other genomic alterations, the clinical data are
                 either absent or insufficient to support routine clinical
                 implementation of biomarker-based therapy. However, there is
                 great interest in optimally matching patients to early-phase
                 clinical trials. Thus, we need accessible, comprehensive, and
                 frequently updated knowledge bases that describe genomic
                 changes and their clinical implications, as well as continued
                 education of clinicians and patients.",

                 germline cancer susceptibility variants. Here we
                 systematically analyse 4,034 cases from The Cancer Genome
                 Atlas cancer cases representing 12 cancer types. We find that
                 the frequency of rare germline truncations in 114
                 cancer-susceptibility-associated genes varies widely, from 4\%
                 (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)) to 19\% (ovarian cancer), with
                 a notably high frequency of 11\% in stomach cancer. Burden
                 testing identifies 13 cancer genes with significant enrichment
                 of rare truncations, some associated with specific cancers
                 (for example, RAD51C, PALB2 and MSH6 in AML, stomach and
                 endometrial cancers, respectively). Significant,
                 tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity occurs in nine genes
                 (ATM, BAP1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, FANCM, PALB2 and RAD51C/D).
                 Moreover, our homology-directed repair assay of 68 BRCA1 rare
                 missense variants supports the utility of allelic enrichment
                 analysis for characterizing variants of unknown significance.
                 The scale of this analysis and the somatic-germline
                 integration enable the detection of rare variants that may
                 affect individual susceptibility to tumour development, a

                 sequence of a gene without directly altering the amino acid
                 sequence of the encoded protein, were thought to have no
                 functional consequences for a long time. They are often
                 assumed to be neutral in models of mutation and selection and
                 were completely ignored in many studies. However, accumulating
                 experimental evidence has demonstrated that these mutations
                 exert their impact on gene functions via splicing accuracy,
                 mRNA stability, translation fidelity, protein folding and
                 expression, and some of these mutations are implicated in
                 human diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there is still
                 no database specially focusing on disease-related SMs.
                 RESULTS: We have developed a new database called dbDSM
                 (database of Deleterious Synonymous Mutation), a continually
                 updated database that collects, curates and manages available
                 human disease-related SM data obtained from published
                 literature. In the current release, dbDSM collects 1936
                 SM-disease association entries, including 1289 SMs and 443
                 human diseases from ClinVar, GRASP, GWAS Catalog, GWASdb,
                 PolymiRTS database, PubMed database and Web of Knowledge.
                 Additionally, we provided users a link to download all the
                 data in the dbDSM and a link to submit novel data into the
                 database. We hope dbDSM will be a useful resource for
                 investigating the roles of SMs in human disease. AVAILABILITY

                 profiling studies have identified somatic single-nucleotide

                 trigger abnormal splicing has not been systematically
                 examined. Here we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from
                 1,812 patients with cancer and identified ∼900 somatic exonic
                 SNVs that disrupt splicing. At least 163 SNVs, including 31
                 synonymous ones, were shown to cause intron retention or exon
                 skipping in an allele-specific manner, with ∼70\% of the SNVs
                 occurring on the last base of exons. Notably, SNVs causing
                 intron retention were enriched in tumor suppressors, and 97\%
                 of these SNVs generated a premature termination codon, leading
                 to loss of function through nonsense-mediated decay or
                 truncated protein. We also characterized the genomic features
                 predictive of such splicing defects. Overall, this work

  abstract    = "Cancer is a disease of the genome caused by oncogene
                 activation and tumor suppressor gene inhibition. Deep
                 sequencing studies including large consortia such as TCGA and
                 ICGC identified numerous tumor-specific mutations not only in
                 protein-coding sequences but also in non-coding sequences.
                 Although 98\% of the genome is not translated into proteins,
                 most studies have neglected the information hidden in this
                 ``dark matter'' of the genome. Malignancy-driving mutations
                 can occur in all genetic elements outside the coding region,
                 namely in enhancer, silencer, insulator, and promoter as well
                 as in 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR Intron or splice site mutations can
                 alter the splicing pattern. Moreover, cancer genomes contain
                 mutations within non-coding RNA, such as microRNA, lncRNA, and
                 lincRNA A synonymous mutation changes the coding region in the
                 DNA and RNA but not the protein sequence. Importantly,
                 oncogenes such as TERT or miR-21 as well as tumor suppressor
                 genes such as TP53/p53, APC, BRCA1, or RB1 can be affected by
                 these alterations. In summary, coding-independent mutations
                 can affect gene regulation from transcription, splicing, mRNA
                 stability to translation, and hence, this largely neglected
                 area needs functional studies to elucidate the mechanisms
                 underlying tumorigenesis. This review will focus on the
                 important role and novel mechanisms of these non-coding or
                 allegedly silent mutations in tumorigenesis.",

  abstract    = "One of the biggest mysteries in cancer research remains why
                 mutations in certain genes cause cancer only at specific sites
                 in the human body. The poor correlation between the expression
                 level of a cancer gene and the tissues in which it causes
                 malignant transformations raises the question of which factors
                 determine the tissue-specific effects of a mutation. Here, we
                 explore why some cancer genes are associated only with few
                 different cancer types (i.e., are specific), while others are
                 found mutated in a large number of different types of cancer
                 (i.e., are general). We do so by contrasting cellular
                 functions of specific-cancer genes with those of general ones
                 to identify properties that determine where in the body a gene
                 mutation is causing malignant transformations. We identified
                 different groups of cancer genes that did not behave as
                 expected (i.e., DNA repair genes being tissue specific, immune
                 response genes showing a bimodal specificity function or
                 strong association of generally expressed genes to particular
                 cancers). Analysis of these three groups demonstrates the
                 importance of environmental impact for understanding why
                 certain cancer genes are only involved in the development of
                 some cancer types but are rarely found mutated in other types

                 cancers. In 2004, the identification of epidermal growth
                 factor receptor (EGFR) somatic mutations provided the first
                 glimpse of a clinically relevant NSCLC oncogene. Approximately
                 70\% of NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the
                 exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase
                 inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved
                 response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in
                 some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR
                 wildtype (WT) cases. Three randomized trials of gefitinib
                 versus chemotherapy (IPASS, WJTOG3405, NEJ002) in stage IV
                 NSCLC have consistently demonstrated better RR and PFS (hazard
                 ratios of 0.48 [IPASS], 0.49 [WJTOG3405] and 0.30 [NEJ002])
                 for EGFR-mutated NSCLCs treated with gefitinib. Novel
                 irreversible EGFR TKIs (afatinib, XL647, PF00299804) show
                 similar activity in EGFR-mutated patients. A translocation
                 involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene with EML4,
                 identified in 2007, is the most recent oncogene found in
                 NSCLC. Crizotinib (PF02341066), an ALK TKI, has shown
                 impressive activity against ALK translocated NSCLC in an
                 expanded cohort of a phase I trial (NCT00585195). Over 80
                 patients have been treated and the RR is ∼60\% with the
                 6-month PFS rate exceeding 70\%. A registration phase III
                 trial of crizotinib versus second-line chemotherapy
                 (pemetrexed/docetaxel) is underway (PROFILE 1007,
                 NCT00932893). KRAS, EGFR mutations and ALK translocations are
                 mutually exclusive and few EGFR WT NSCLCs respond to EGFR
                 TKIs. The promising results of EGFR and ALK TKIs in molecular

                 prognostic role of K-RAS mutations in NSCLC. Herein we
                 performed a systematic review of the literatures with
                 meta-analysis to assess K-RAS mutations' prognostic value in

                 (HRs) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were
                 calculated in terms of overall survival. 41 trials (6939
                 patients) were included in the analysis, the overall HR was
                 1.45 (95\% CI: 1.29-1.62), showing that K-RAS mutations have
                 an unfavorable impact on survival of patients with NSCLC. Then
                 a subgroup analysis was performed about ethnicity, the
                 combined HR was 1.97 (95\% CI: 1.58-2.44) for Asians, and 1.37
                 (95\% CI: 1.25-1.5) for non-Asians. In subgroup analysis of
                 histology, the HR was 1.39 (95\% CI: 1.24-1.55) for
                 adenocarcinoma, suggesting that K-RAS mutations were
                 correlated with shortened survival for adenocarcinoma. When
                 the subgroup analysis was conducted according to disease
                 stage, K-RAS mutations were poor prognostic factors in early
                 stages: stage I (1.81; 95\% CI: 1.36-2.39) and stage I-IIIa
                 (1.68; 95\% CI: 1.11-2.55), but not in advanced stage
                 (IIIb-IV) (1.3; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.71). At last, in subgroup
                 analysis about test methods, all of the four methods: PCR-MSOP
                 (1.73; 95\% CI: 1.35-2.2), PCR-DGGE (1.27; 95\% CI:

                 impact on survival of NSCLC patients. In conclusion, this
                 meta-analysis suggests that K-RAS mutations are associated

                 survival with genetic polymorphisms in X-ray repair
                 cross-complementing group 1 and group 3 (XRCC3), xeroderma

                 factor, methylene-tetra-hydrofolate reductase and methionine
                 synthase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five
                 stage IV or IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) NSCLC
                 patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine from different
                 hospitals of the Spanish Lung Cancer Group were genotyped for
                 14 different polymorphisms in 13 genes. Polymorphisms were
                 detected by the TaqMan method, using genomic DNA extracted
                 from baseline blood samples. RESULTS: Median survival was
                 significantly increased in patients harboring XRCC3 241
                 MetMet: 16 months versus 10 months for patients with ThrMet
                 and 14 months for those with ThrThr (P = 0.01). The risk of
                 death ratio was significantly lower for MetMet than for ThrMet
                 patients (hazard ratio, 0.43; P = 0.01). In the multivariate
                 Cox model, XRCC3 241 remained an independent prognostic factor
                 (hazard ratio: XRCC3 241 MetMet, 0.44; P = 0.01), and XPD 751
                 and XRCC1 399 also emerged as significant prognostic factors
                 (hazard ratios: XPD 751 LysGln, 0.46, P = 0.03; XRCC1 399
                 ArgGln, 0.61, P = 0.04). No other association was observed
                 between genotype and survival. CONCLUSION: XRCC3 241 MetMet is
                 an independent determinant of favorable survival in NSCLC
                 patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine. A simple
                 molecular assay to determine the XRCC3 241 genotype can be

                 germ-line variation on survival among women with breast cancer
                 participating in a British population-based study. Up to 2430
                 cases for whom current vital status data were available were
                 screened for BRCA1/2 mutations and genotyped for polymorphisms
                 in 22 DNA repair, hormone metabolism, carcinogen metabolism,
                 and other genes. The effect of genotype on outcome was
                 assessed by Cox regression analysis. The largest effect was
                 observed for the silent polymorphism D501D (t>c) in LIG4, a
                 gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair. The estimated

                 this effect remained after stratification by stage, grade, and
                 tumor type [HR, 4.2 (1.8-9.4); P = 0.01]. Total length of a
                 CYP19 IVS4 (ttta)(n) repeat was also associated with survival
                 [HR, 0.9 (0.8-1.0); P = 0.01], but this became nonsignificant

                 prognostic factors, the HR estimate decreased to 2.0 and
                 became nonsignificant (P = 0.4). CYP17 (P = 0.05) and TP53 (P
                 = 0.06) polymorphisms showed marginally significant
                 associations in unstratified analyses. No effect on survival
                 was seen for polymorphisms in ATM, BRCA1/2, CHK2, KU70, NBS1,

                 clinical data from 289 UK-resident patients with lung

                 genotyped these candidate SNPs in a validation series of 748
                 patients from Italy that resulted genetically compatible with
                 the UK series based on principal component analysis. In a Cox
                 proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex and clinical
                 stage, four SNPs were confirmed on the basis of their having a

                 the two series and p < 0.05. The strongest association was

                 organised and assembled into dedicated biological pathway
                 resources that serve as an invaluable tool, not only for
                 structuring the information about molecular interactions but
                 also for making it available for biological, clinical and
                 computational studies. With the advent of high-throughput
                 molecular profiling of tumours, close to complete molecular
                 catalogues of mutations, gene expression and epigenetic
                 modifications are available and require adequate
                 interpretation. Taking into account the information about
                 biological signalling machinery in cells may help to better
                 interpret molecular profiles of tumours. Making sense out of
                 these descriptions requires biological pathway resources for
                 functional interpretation of the data. In this review, we

                 current approaches for data integration, visualisation and
                 analysis, using biological networks, such as pathway scoring,

                 families that orchestrate functional processes in complex
                 cellular networks, and when perturbed, can cause various
                 cancers. The abundance and diversity of genetic, structural,
                 and biochemical data underlies the complexity of mechanisms by
                 which targeted and personalized drugs can combat mutational
                 profiles in protein kinases. Coupled with the evolution of
                 system biology approaches, genomic and proteomic technologies
                 are rapidly identifying and charactering novel resistance
                 mechanisms with the goal to inform rationale design of
                 personalized kinase drugs. Integration of experimental and
                 computational approaches can help to bring these data into a
                 unified conceptual framework and develop robust models for
                 predicting the clinical drug resistance. In the current study,
                 we employ a battery of synergistic computational approaches
                 that integrate genetic, evolutionary, biochemical, and
                 structural data to characterize the effect of cancer mutations
                 in protein kinases. We provide a detailed structural
                 classification and analysis of genetic signatures associated
                 with oncogenic mutations. By integrating genetic and
                 structural data, we employ network modeling to dissect
                 mechanisms of kinase drug sensitivities to oncogenic EGFR
                 mutations. Using biophysical simulations and analysis of
                 protein structure networks, we show that
                 conformational-specific drug binding of Lapatinib may elicit
                 resistant mutations in the EGFR kinase that are linked with
                 the ligand-mediated changes in the residue interaction
                 networks and global network properties of key residues that
                 are responsible for structural stability of specific
                 functional states. A strong network dependency on high
                 centrality residues in the conformation-specific
                 Lapatinib-EGFR complex may explain vulnerability of drug
                 binding to a broad spectrum of mutations and the emergence of
                 drug resistance. Our study offers a systems-based perspective
                 on drug design by unravelling complex relationships between
                 robustness of targeted kinase genes and binding specificity of

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Currently there are no curative anticancer drugs,
                 and drug resistance is often acquired after drug treatment.
                 One of the reasons is that cancers are complex diseases,
                 regulated by multiple signaling pathways and cross talks among
                 the pathways. It is expected that drug combinations can reduce
                 drug resistance and improve patients' outcomes. In clinical
                 practice, the ideal and feasible drug combinations are
                 combinations of existing Food and Drug Administration-approved
                 drugs or bioactive compounds that are already used on patients
                 or have entered clinical trials and passed safety tests. These
                 drug combinations could directly be used on patients with less
                 concern of toxic effects. However, there is so far no
                 effective computational approach to search effective drug
                 combinations from the enormous number of possibilities.
                 RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel systematic
                 computational tool DRUGCOMBORANKER: to prioritize synergistic
                 drug combinations and uncover their mechanisms of action. We
                 first build a drug functional network based on their genomic
                 profiles, and partition the network into numerous drug network
                 communities by using a Bayesian non-negative matrix
                 factorization approach. As drugs within overlapping community
                 share common mechanisms of action, we next uncover potential
                 targets of drugs by applying a recommendation system on drug
                 communities. We meanwhile build disease-specific signaling
                 networks based on patients' genomic profiles and interactome
                 data. We then identify drug combinations by searching drugs
                 whose targets are enriched in the complementary signaling
                 modules of the disease signaling network. The novel method was
                 evaluated on lung adenocarcinoma and endocrine receptor
                 positive breast cancer, and compared with other drug
                 combination approaches. These case studies discovered a set of
                 effective drug combinations top ranked in our prediction list,
                 and mapped the drug targets on the disease signaling network
                 to highlight the mechanisms of action of the drug
                 combinations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The program is

                 the use of complementary experimental approaches,

                 Ultimately, these diverse alterations often lead to the

                 CpG dinucleotides relative to non-CpG sites varies between
                 genes and relative to the genomic average. In particular we

                 higher in our disease genes than amongst DNMs in general; the

                 the identification of driver genes. Although existing methods

                 for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
                 inhibitors in unselected patients with head and neck squamous
                 cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, a patient with stage IVA
                 HNSCC received 13 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib and
                 experienced a near-complete histologic response. OBJECTIVE: To
                 determine a mechanism of exceptional response to erlotinib
                 therapy in HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single
                 patient with locally advanced HNSCC who received erlotinib
                 monotherapy in a window-of-opportunity clinical trial
                 (patients scheduled to undergo primary cancer surgery are
                 treated briefly with an investigational agent). Whole-exome
                 sequencing of pretreatment tumor and germline patient samples
                 was performed at a quaternary care academic medical center,
                 and a candidate somatic variant was experimentally
                 investigated for mediating erlotinib response. INTERVENTION: A
                 brief course of erlotinib monotherapy followed by surgical
                 resection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of
                 pretreatment tumor somatic alterations that may contribute to
                 the exceptional response to erlotinib. Hypotheses were
                 formulated regarding enhanced erlotinib response in
                 preclinical models harboring the patient tumor somatic variant
                 MAPK1 E322K following the identification of tumor somatic
                 variants. RESULTS: No EGFR alterations were observed in the
                 pretreatment tumor DNA. Paradoxically, the tumor harbored an
                 activating MAPK1 E322K mutation (allelic fraction 0.13), which
                 predicts ERK activation and erlotinib resistance in
                 EGFR-mutant lung cancer. The HNSCC cells with MAPK1 E322K
                 exhibited enhanced EGFR phosphorylation and erlotinib
                 sensitivity compared with wild-type MAPK1 cells. CONCLUSIONS
                 AND RELEVANCE: Selective erlotinib use in HNSCC may be
                 informed by precision oncology approaches.",

                 G-quadruplexes (G4) has recently been obtained in seminal
                 studies performed in a variety of organisms. Four-stranded
                 G-quadruplex DNA structures are promising drug targets as
                 these non-canonical structures appear to be involved in a
                 number of key biological processes. Given the growing interest
                 for G4, accurate tools to predict G-quadruplex propensity of a
                 given DNA or RNA sequence are needed. Several algorithms such
                 as Quadparser predict quadruplex forming propensity. However,
                 a number of studies have established that sequences that are
                 not detected by these tools do form G4 structures (false
                 negatives) and that other sequences predicted to form G4
                 structures do not (false positives). Here we report
                 development and testing of a radically different algorithm,
                 G4Hunter that takes into account G-richness and G-skewness of
                 a given sequence and gives a quadruplex propensity score as
                 output. To validate this model, we tested it on a large
                 dataset of 392 published sequences and experimentally
                 evaluated quadruplex forming potential of 209 sequences using
                 a combination of biophysical methods to assess quadruplex
                 formation in vitro. We experimentally validated the G4Hunter
                 algorithm on a short complete genome, that of the human
                 mitochondria (16.6 kb), because of its relatively high GC
                 content and GC skewness as well as the biological relevance of
                 these quadruplexes near instability hotspots. We then applied
                 the algorithm to genomes of a number of species, including
                 humans, allowing us to conclude that the number of sequences
                 capable of forming stable quadruplexes (at least in vitro) in
                 the human genome is significantly higher, by a factor of 2-10,

                 Previous studies have only considered the immediately flanking
                 nucleotides around a polymorphic site-the site's trinucleotide
                 sequence context-to study polymorphism levels across the

  abstract    = "Mutational processes constantly shape the somatic genome,
                 leading to immunity, aging, cancer, and other diseases. When
                 cancer is the outcome, we are afforded a glimpse into these
                 processes by the clonal expansion of the malignant cell. Here,
                 we characterize a less explored layer of the mutational
                 landscape of cancer: mutational asymmetries between the two
                 DNA strands. Analyzing whole-genome sequences of 590 tumors
                 from 14 different cancer types, we reveal widespread
                 asymmetries across mutagenic processes, with transcriptional
                 (``T-class'') asymmetry dominating UV-, smoking-, and
                 liver-cancer-associated mutations and replicative
                 (``R-class'') asymmetry dominating POLE-, APOBEC-, and
                 MSI-associated mutations. We report a striking phenomenon of
                 transcription-coupled damage (TCD) on the non-transcribed DNA
                 strand and provide evidence that APOBEC mutagenesis occurs on
                 the lagging-strand template during DNA replication. As more
                 genomes are sequenced, studying and classifying their
                 asymmetries will illuminate the underlying biological
                 mechanisms of DNA damage and repair.",

                 cycle checkpoints, known as the DNA damage response (DDR), is
                 associated with a predisposition to cancer and affects
                 responses to DNA-damaging anticancer therapy. Dysfunction of
                 one DNA repair pathway may be compensated for by the function
                 of another compensatory DDR pathway, which may be increased
                 and contribute to resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and
                 radiotherapy. Therefore, DDR pathways make an ideal target for
                 therapeutic intervention; first, to prevent or reverse therapy
                 resistance; and second, using a synthetic lethal approach to
                 specifically kill cancer cells that are dependent on a
                 compensatory DNA repair pathway for survival in the context of

                 provides an intuitive graphical user interface and a
                 documented application programming interface (API) for
                 querying these data. DGIdb was assembled through an extensive
                 manual curation effort, reflecting the combined information of
                 twenty-seven sources. For DGIdb 2.0, substantial updates have
                 been made to increase content and improve its usefulness as a
                 resource for mining clinically actionable drug targets.
                 Specifically, nine new sources of drug-gene interactions have
                 been added, including seven resources specifically focused on
                 interactions linked to clinical trials. These additions have
                 more than doubled the overall count of drug-gene interactions.
                 The total number of druggable gene claims has also increased
                 by 30\%. Importantly, a majority of the unrestricted,
                 publicly-accessible sources used in DGIdb are now
                 automatically updated on a weekly basis, providing the most
                 current information for these sources. Finally, a new web view
                 and API have been developed to allow searching for
                 interactions by drug identifiers to complement existing
                 gene-based search functionality. With these updates, DGIdb

                 a clinical tool, a full understanding of the variables

                 tumour-normal sample pairs from two different types of cancer,
                 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, we conduct
                 a benchmarking exercise within the context of the

                 methods, analysis pipelines and validation methods. We show
                 that using PCR-free methods and increasing sequencing depth to
                 ∼100 \texttimes{} shows benefits, as long as the
                 tumour:control coverage ratio remains balanced. We observe
                 widely varying mutation call rates and low concordance among

                 the raw data and lack of standards for dealing with the

                 tumour in addition to the germline variants in their inherited
                 genome. Although variants in protein-coding regions have
                 received the most attention, numerous studies have noted the
                 importance of non-coding variants in cancer. Moreover, the
                 overwhelming majority of variants, both somatic and germline,

                 single nucleotide variants to large genomic rearrangements -
                 and the wide range of mechanisms by which they affect gene
                 expression to promote tumorigenesis, such as disrupting
                 transcription factor-binding sites or functions of non-coding

  abstract    = "Small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors are widely used to
                 elucidate cellular signaling pathways and are promising
                 therapeutic agents. Owing to evolutionary conservation of the
                 ATP-binding site, most kinase inhibitors that target this site
                 promiscuously inhibit multiple kinases. Interpretation of
                 experiments that use these compounds is confounded by a lack
                 of data on the comprehensive kinase selectivity of most
                 inhibitors. Here we used functional assays to profile the
                 activity of 178 commercially available kinase inhibitors
                 against a panel of 300 recombinant protein kinases.
                 Quantitative analysis revealed complex and often unexpected
                 interactions between protein kinases and kinase inhibitors,
                 with a wide spectrum of promiscuity. Many off-target
                 interactions occur with seemingly unrelated kinases, revealing
                 how large-scale profiling can identify multitargeted
                 inhibitors of specific, diverse kinases. The results have
                 implications for drug development and provide a resource for

                 Our data show that, as a class, type II inhibitors are more
                 selective than type I inhibitors, but that there are important
                 exceptions to this trend. The data further illustrate that
                 selective inhibitors have been developed against the majority
                 of kinases targeted by the compounds tested. Analysis of the

                 inhibitors broadly active against a single subfamily of
                 kinases, but selective outside that subfamily. The data set

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: An enduring challenge in personalized medicine is
                 to select right drug for individual patients. Testing drugs on
                 patients in large clinical trials is one way to assess their
                 efficacy and toxicity, but it is impractical to test hundreds
                 of drugs currently under development. Therefore the
                 preclinical prediction model is highly expected as it enables
                 prediction of drug response to hundreds of cell lines in
                 parallel. METHODS: Recently, two large-scale pharmacogenomic
                 studies screened multiple anticancer drugs on over 1000 cell
                 lines in an effort to elucidate the response mechanism of
                 anticancer drugs. To this aim, we here used gene expression
                 features and drug sensitivity data in Cancer Cell Line
                 Encyclopedia (CCLE) to build a predictor based on Support
                 Vector Machine (SVM) and a recursive feature selection tool.
                 Robustness of our model was validated by cross-validation and
                 an independent dataset, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP).
                 RESULTS: Our model achieved good cross validation performance
                 for most drugs in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (≥80\%
                 accuracy for 10 drugs, ≥75\% accuracy for 19 drugs).
                 Independent tests on eleven common drugs between CCLE and CGP
                 achieved satisfactory performance for three of them, i.e.,
                 AZD6244, Erlotinib and PD-0325901, using expression levels of
                 only twelve, six and seven genes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
                 These results suggest that drug response could be effectively
                 predicted from genomic features. Our model could be applied to
                 predict drug response for some certain drugs and potentially
                 play a complementary role in personalized medicine.",

                 signal transduction pathways. On occasion, the activation of
                 one pathway can produce an effect downstream of another
                 pathway, a phenomenon known as crosstalk. Existing
                 computational methods to discover such pathway pairs rely on
                 simple overlap statistics. RESULTS: We present Xtalk, a
                 path-based approach for identifying pairs of pathways that may
                 crosstalk. Xtalk computes the statistical significance of the
                 average length of multiple short paths that connect receptors
                 in one pathway to the transcription factors in another. By
                 design, Xtalk reports the precise interactions and mechanisms
                 that support the identified crosstalk. We applied Xtalk to
                 signaling pathways in the KEGG and NCI-PID databases. We
                 manually curated a gold standard set of 132 crosstalking
                 pathway pairs and a set of 140 pairs that did not crosstalk,
                 for which Xtalk achieved an area under the receiver operator
                 characteristic curve of 0.65, a 12\% improvement over the
                 closest competing approach. The area under the receiver
                 operator characteristic curve varied with the pathway,
                 suggesting that crosstalk should be evaluated on a
                 pathway-by-pathway level. We also analyzed an extended set of
                 658 pathway pairs in KEGG and to a set of more than 7000
                 pathway pairs in NCI-PID. For the top-ranking pairs, we found
                 substantial support in the literature (81\% for KEGG and 78\%
                 for NCI-PID). We provide examples of networks computed by
                 Xtalk that accurately recovered known mechanisms of crosstalk.

                 amplification of DNA, even from minute starting quantities.
                 PCR is a fundamental step in preparing DNA samples for
                 high-throughput sequencing. However, there are errors
                 associated with PCR-mediated amplification. Here we examine
                 the effects of four important sources of error-bias,
                 stochasticity, template switches and polymerase errors-on
                 sequence representation in low-input next-generation
                 sequencing libraries. We designed a pool of diverse PCR
                 amplicons with a defined structure, and then used Illumina
                 sequencing to search for signatures of each process. We
                 further developed quantitative models for each process, and
                 compared predictions of these models to our experimental data.
                 We find that PCR stochasticity is the major force skewing
                 sequence representation after amplification of a pool of
                 unique DNA amplicons. Polymerase errors become very common in
                 later cycles of PCR but have little impact on the overall
                 sequence distribution as they are confined to small copy
                 numbers. PCR template switches are rare and confined to low
                 copy numbers. Our results provide a theoretical basis for
                 removing distortions from high-throughput sequencing data. In
                 addition, our findings on PCR stochasticity will have
                 particular relevance to quantification of results from single

                 However, due to the exponentially increasing number of

                 are needed for prioritizing the most potent multi-target
                 alternatives on a global network level. We took a functional
                 systems pharmacology approach toward the identification of
                 selective target combinations for specific cancer cells by
                 combining large-scale screening data on drug treatment
                 efficacies and drug-target binding affinities. Our model-based

                 drug efficacies through system-level target inhibition
                 networks. Case studies in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
                 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells demonstrated how the target
                 inhibition modeling allows systematic exploration of
                 functional interactions between drugs and their targets to
                 maximally inhibit multiple survival pathways in a given cancer
                 type. The TIMMA prediction results were experimentally
                 validated by means of systematic siRNA-mediated silencing of
                 the selected targets and their pairwise combinations, showing
                 increased ability to identify not only such druggable kinase
                 targets that are essential for cancer survival either
                 individually or in combination, but also synergistic
                 interactions indicative of non-additive drug efficacies. These
                 system-level analyses were enabled by a novel model

                 pathways ('specific synergy'). Such cases of drug synergy
                 should tend to correspond to synergistic genetic interaction

                 increased bioavailability. To assess the relative abundance of

                 response to compounds applied jointly, termed synergy, has the
                 potential to provide many therapeutic benefits. Therefore,
                 high throughput screening of compound combinations has
                 recently received a great deal of attention. Large compound
                 libraries and the feasibility of all-pairs screening can
                 easily generate large, information-rich datasets. Previously,
                 these datasets have been visualized using either a heat-map or
                 a network approach-however these visualizations only partially
                 represent the information encoded in the dataset. RESULTS: A
                 new visualization technique for pairwise combination screening
                 data, termed ``Synergy Maps'', is presented. In a Synergy Map,
                 information about the synergistic interactions of compounds is
                 integrated with information about their properties (chemical
                 structure, physicochemical properties, bioactivity profiles)
                 to produce a single visualization. As a result the
                 relationships between compound and combination properties may
                 be investigated simultaneously, and thus may afford insight
                 into the synergy observed in the screen. An interactive web
                 app implementation, available at
                 http://richlewis42.github.io/synergy-maps, has been developed
                 for public use, which may find use in navigating and filtering
                 larger scale combination datasets. This tool is applied to a
                 recent all-pairs dataset of anti-malarials, tested against
                 Plasmodium falciparum, and a preliminary analysis is given as
                 an example, illustrating the disproportionate synergism of
                 histone deacetylase inhibitors previously described in
                 literature, as well as suggesting new hypotheses for future
                 investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Synergy Maps improve the state of
                 the art in compound combination visualization, by
                 simultaneously representing individual compound properties and
                 their interactions. The web-based tool allows straightforward

               diseases, like cancer, HIV and cardiovascular diseases. One of
               the most important characteristics for drug combinations is the
               synergistic effects among different drugs, that is to say, the
               combination effects are larger than the sum of individual
               effects. Although quantitative methods can be utilized to
               evaluate the synergistic effects based on experimental
               dose--response data, it is both time and resource consuming to
               screen all possible combinations by experimental trials. This
               problem makes it a formidable challenge to recognize synergistic
               combinations. Various attempts have been made to predict drug
               synergy by network biology, however, most of them are limited to
               estimating target associations on the PPI network. Here, we

               synergistic therapeutic effects. In general, drugs acting on the

                 Cells respond to DNA damage by activating complex signalling
                 networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA repair
                 and survival but also cell death. The decision between cell
                 survival and death following DNA damage rests on factors that

                 damage tolerance, as well as on factors involved in the
                 activation of apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and senescence.

                 sensitive to unknown distributions of functions within

                 density-based clustering methods in 21 tumor types to detect
                 variably sized significantly mutated regions (SMRs). SMRs
                 reveal recurrent alterations across a spectrum of coding and
                 noncoding elements, including transcription factor binding
                 sites and untranslated regions mutated in up to ∼15\% of

                 alterations in molecular domains and at interfaces, often with
                 associated changes in signaling. Mutation frequencies in SMRs
                 demonstrate that distinct protein regions are differentially
                 mutated across tumor types, as exemplified by a linker region
                 of PIK3CA in which biophysical simulations suggest that

                 their intended therapeutic targets and a substantial portion
                 of these interactions is yet to be elucidated. Protein-Drug
                 Interaction Database (PDID) addresses incompleteness of these
                 data by providing access to putative protein-drug interactions
                 that cover the entire structural human proteome. RESULTS: PDID
                 covers 9652 structures from 3746 proteins and houses 16 800
                 putative interactions generated from close to 1.1 million
                 accurate, all-atom structure-based predictions for several
                 dozens of popular drugs. The predictions were generated with
                 three modern methods: ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite. They are
                 accompanied by propensity scores that quantify likelihood of
                 interactions and coordinates of the putative location of the
                 binding drugs in the corresponding protein structures. PDID
                 complements the current databases that focus on the curated
                 interactions and the BioDrugScreen database that relies on
                 docking to find putative interactions. Moreover, we also

                 protein and biologically relevant ligands is an important step
                 toward understanding the protein functions. Most
                 ligand-binding sites prediction methods use the protein
                 structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates.
                 However, not all ligands present in the PDB are biologically
                 relevant, as small molecules are often used as additives for
                 solving the protein structures. To facilitate template-based
                 ligand-protein docking, virtual ligand screening and protein
                 function annotations, we develop a hierarchical procedure for
                 assessing the biological relevance of ligands present in the
                 PDB structures, which involves a four-step biological feature

              and carries a poor prognosis for most patients. While precision
              targeting of mutated proteins has given some successes for never-
              and light-smoking patients, there are no proven targeted
              therapies for the majority of smokers with the disease. Despite
              sequencing hundreds of lung cancers, known driver mutations are
              lacking for a majority of tumors. Distinguishing driver mutations
              from inconsequential passenger mutations in a given lung tumor is
              extremely challenging due to the high mutational burden of
              smoking-related cancers. Here we discuss the methods employed to
              identify driver mutations from these large datasets. We examine
              different approaches based on bioinformatics, in silico
              structural modeling and biological dependency screens and discuss
              the limitations of these approaches.",

  abstract    = "A massive amount of somatic mutations has been cataloged in
                 large-scale projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
                 and the International Cancer Genome Consortium projects. The
                 majority of the somatic mutations found in tumor genomes are
                 neutral 'passenger' rather than damaging 'driver' mutations.
                 Now, understanding their biological consequences and
                 prioritizing them for druggable targets are urgently needed.
                 Thanks to the rapid advances in structural genomics
                 technologies (e.g. X-ray), large-scale protein structural data
                 has now been made available, providing critical information
                 for deciphering functional roles of mutations in cancer and
                 prioritizing those alterations that may mediate drug binding
                 at the atom resolution and, as such, be druggable targets. We
                 hypothesized that mutations at protein-ligand binding-site
                 residues are likely to be druggable targets. Thus, to
                 prioritize druggable mutations, we developed SGDriver, a
                 structural genomics-based method incorporating the somatic
                 missense mutations into protein-ligand binding-site residues
                 using a Bayes inference statistical framework. We applied
                 SGDriver to 746,631 missense mutations observed in 4,997
                 tumor-normal pairs across 16 cancer types from TCGA. SGDriver
                 detected 14,471 potential druggable mutations in 2,091
                 proteins (including 1,516 recurrently mutated proteins) across
                 3,558 cancer genomes (71.2\%), and further identified 298
                 proteins harboring mutations that were significantly enriched
                 at protein-ligand binding-site residues (adjusted P value <
                 0.05). The identified proteins are significantly enriched in
                 both oncoproteins and tumor suppressors. The follow-up
                 drug-target network analysis suggested 98 known and 126
                 repurposed druggable anticancer targets (e.g. SPOP and NR3C1).
                 Furthermore, our integrative analysis indicated that 13\% of
                 patients might benefit from current targeted therapy, and this
                 proportion would increase to 31\% when considering drug
                 repositioning. This study provides a testable strategy for
                 prioritizing druggable mutations in precision cancer medicine.",

                 the driving pathways underlying disease mechanisms and the
                 heterogeneity of cancers. It is well known that somatic genome
                 alterations (SGAs) affecting the genes that encode the
                 proteins within a common signaling pathway exhibit mutual
                 exclusivity, in which these SGAs usually do not co-occur in a
                 tumor. With some success, this characteristic has been
                 utilized as an objective function to guide the search for
                 driver mutations within a pathway. However, mutual exclusivity
                 alone is not sufficient to indicate that genes affected by
                 such SGAs are in common pathways. Here, we propose a novel,
                 signal-oriented framework for identifying driver SGAs. First,
                 we identify the perturbed cellular signals by mining the gene
                 expression data. Next, we search for a set of SGA events that
                 carries strong information with respect to such perturbed
                 signals while exhibiting mutual exclusivity. Finally, we
                 design and implement an efficient exact algorithm to solve an
                 NP-hard problem encountered in our approach. We apply this
                 framework to the ovarian and glioblastoma tumor data available
                 at the TCGA database, and perform systematic evaluations. Our
                 results indicate that the signal-oriented approach enhances
                 the ability to find informative sets of driver SGAs that
                 likely constitute signaling pathways.",

                 that are impure, aneuploid or clonally heterogeneous. To
                 reassess optimal sequencing strategies, we performed
                 ultra-deep (up to ~312\texttimes{}{}) whole genome sequencing
                 (WGS) and exome capture (up to ~433\texttimes{}{}) of a
                 primary acute myeloid leukemia, its subsequent relapse, and a
                 matched normal skin sample. We tested multiple alignment and
                 variant calling algorithms and validated ~200,000 putative
                 SNVs by sequencing them to depths of ~1,000\texttimes{}{}.
                 Additional targeted sequencing provided over
                 10,000\texttimes{} coverage and ddPCR assays provided up to
                 ~250,000\texttimes{} sampling of selected sites. We evaluated
                 the effects of different library generation approaches, depth
                 of sequencing, and analysis strategies on the ability to
                 effectively characterize a complex tumor. This dataset,

                 identification of the most-important somatic mutations ('major
                 drivers') that cause tumour growth. However, many mutations
                 found in cancer might not be major drivers or 'passenger'
                 mutations, but instead might have relatively weak
                 tumour-promoting effects. Our aim is to highlight the
                 existence of these mutations (termed 'mini drivers' herein),
                 as multiple mini-driver mutations might substitute for a
                 major-driver change, especially in the presence of genomic
                 instability or high mutagen exposure. The mini-driver model
                 has clinical implications: for example, the effects of
                 therapeutically targeting such genes may be limited. However,
                 the main importance of the model lies in helping to provide a
                 complete understanding of tumorigenesis, especially as we
                 anticipate that an increasing number of mini-driver mutations

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of cancer cases present
                 with a metastatic tumor and require further testing to
                 determine the primary site; many of these are never fully
                 diagnosed and remain cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP).
                 It has been previously demonstrated that the somatic point
                 mutations detected in a tumor can be used to identify its site
                 of origin with limited accuracy. We hypothesized that higher
                 accuracy could be achieved by a classification algorithm based
                 on the following feature sets: 1) the number of nonsynonymous
                 point mutations in a set of 232 specific cancer-associated
                 genes, 2) frequencies of the 96 classes of single-nucleotide
                 substitution determined by the flanking bases, and 3) copy
                 number profiles, if available. METHODS: We used publicly
                 available somatic mutation data from the COSMIC database to
                 train random forest classifiers to distinguish among those
                 tissues of origin for which sufficient data was available. We
                 selected feature sets using cross-validation and then derived
                 two final classifiers (with or without copy number profiles)
                 using 80 \% of the available tumors. We evaluated the accuracy
                 using the remaining 20 \%. For further validation, we assessed
                 accuracy of the without-copy-number classifier on three
                 independent data sets: 1669 newly available public tumors of
                 various types, a cohort of 91 breast metastases, and a set of
                 24 specimens from 9 lung cancer patients subjected to
                 multiregion sequencing. RESULTS: The cross-validation accuracy
                 was highest when all three types of information were used. On
                 the left-out COSMIC data not used for training, we achieved a
                 classification accuracy of 85 \% across 6 primary sites (with
                 copy numbers), and 69 \% across 10 primary sites (without copy
                 numbers). Importantly, a derived confidence score could
                 distinguish tumors that could be identified with 95 \%
                 accuracy (32 \%/75 \% of tumors with/without copy numbers)
                 from those that were less certain. Accuracy in the independent
                 data sets was 46 \%, 53 \% and 89 \% respectively, similar to
                 the accuracy expected from the training data. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Identification of primary site from point mutation and/or copy
                 number data may be accurate enough to aid clinical diagnosis
                 of cancers of unknown primary origin.",

                 and genetic disease. We investigated genome-wide mutation
                 rates and spectra in multi-sibling families. The mutation rate
                 increased with paternal age in all families, but the number of
                 additional mutations per year differed by more than twofold
                 between families. Meta-analysis of 6,570 mutations showed that
                 germline methylation influences mutation rates. In contrast to
                 somatic mutations, we found remarkable consistency in germline
                 mutation spectra between the sexes and at different paternal
                 ages. In parental germ line, 3.8\% of mutations were mosaic,
                 resulting in 1.3\% of mutations being shared by siblings. The
                 number of these shared mutations varied significantly between
                 families. Our data suggest that the mutation rate per cell
                 division is higher during both early embryogenesis and
                 differentiation of primordial germ cells but is reduced
                 substantially during post-pubertal spermatogenesis. These

                 To test this idea, we correlated the sensitivity patterns of
                 481 compounds with ∼19,000 basal transcript levels across 823
                 different human cancer cell lines and identified selective

                 biomarkers of drug response and the design of new therapeutic
                 options, which are key challenges in precision medicine.
                 However such data are scattered and lack standards for
                 efficient access and analysis, consequently preventing the
                 realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics. To
                 address these issues, we implemented PharmacoGx, an
                 easy-to-use, open source package for integrative analysis of
                 multiple pharmacogenomic datasets. We demonstrate the utility
                 of our package in comparing large drug sensitivity datasets,
                 such as the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cance and the
                 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Moreover, we show how to use
                 our package to easily perform Connectivity Map analysis. With
                 increasing availability of drug-related data, our package will
                 open new avenues of research for meta-analysis of
                 pharmacogenomic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
                 PharmacoGx is implemented in R and can be easily installed on

                 streamline the design and construction of biological devices
                 through standardized parts. Modular synthetic biology devices
                 are designed by means of an adequate elimination of cross-talk
                 that makes circuits orthogonal and specific. To that end,
                 synthetic constructs need to be adequately optimized through
                 in silico modeling by choosing the right complement of genetic
                 parts and by experimental tuning through directed evolution
                 and craftsmanship. In this review, we consider an additional
                 and complementary tool available to the synthetic biologist
                 for innovative design and successful construction of desired
                 circuit functionalities: biological synergies. Synergy is a
                 prevalent emergent property in biological systems that arises
                 from the concerted action of multiple factors producing an
                 amplification or cancelation effect compared with individual
                 actions alone. Synergies appear in domains as diverse as those
                 involved in chemical and protein activity, polypharmacology,
                 and metabolic pathway complementarity. In conventional
                 synthetic biology designs, synergistic cross-talk between
                 parts and modules is generally attenuated in order to verify
                 their orthogonality. Synergistic interactions, however, can
                 induce emergent behavior that might prove useful for synthetic
                 biology applications, like in functional circuit design,
                 multi-drug treatment, or in sensing and delivery devices.
                 Synergistic design principles are therefore complementary to
                 those coming from orthogonal design and may provide added
                 value to synthetic biology applications. The appropriate
                 modeling, characterization, and design of synergies between

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Multicomponent therapeutics offer bright prospects
                 for the control of complex diseases in a synergistic manner.
                 However, finding ways to screen the synergistic combinations
                 from numerous pharmacological agents is still an ongoing
                 challenge. RESULTS: In this work, we proposed for the first
                 time a ``network target''-based paradigm instead of the
                 traditional ``single target''-based paradigm for virtual
                 screening and established an algorithm termed NIMS (Network
                 target-based Identification of Multicomponent Synergy) to
                 prioritize synergistic agent combinations in a high throughput
                 way. NIMS treats a disease-specific biological network as a
                 therapeutic target and assumes that the relationship among
                 agents can be transferred to network interactions among the
                 molecular level entities (targets or responsive gene products)
                 of agents. Then, two parameters in NIMS, Topology Score and
                 Agent Score, are created to evaluate the synergistic
                 relationship between each given agent combinations. Taking the
                 empirical multicomponent system traditional Chinese medicine
                 (TCM) as an illustrative case, we applied NIMS to prioritize
                 synergistic agent pairs from 63 agents on a pathological
                 process instanced by angiogenesis. The NIMS outputs can not
                 only recover five known synergistic agent pairs, but also
                 obtain experimental verification for synergistic candidates
                 combined with, for example, a herbal ingredient Sinomenine,
                 which outperforms the meet/min method. The robustness of NIMS
                 was also showed regarding the background networks, agent genes
                 and topological parameters, respectively. Finally, we
                 characterized the potential mechanisms of multicomponent
                 synergy from a network target perspective. CONCLUSIONS: NIMS
                 is a first-step computational approach towards identification
                 of synergistic drug combinations at the molecular level. The
                 network target-based approaches may adjust current virtual
                 screen mode and provide a systematic paradigm for facilitating
                 the development of multicomponent therapeutics as well as the

                 To overcome these barriers, it is important to understand the

                 effects. Therefore, modern drug discovery is routinely
                 supported by computational techniques, which can identify
                 alternate molecular targets with a significant potential for
                 cross-reactivity. In particular, the development of highly
                 selective kinase inhibitors is complicated by the strong
                 conservation of the ATP-binding site across the kinase family.
                 In this paper, we describe X-React(KIN), a new machine
                 learning approach that extends the modeling and virtual
                 screening of individual protein kinases to a system level in
                 order to construct a cross-reactivity virtual profile for the
                 human kinome. To maximize the coverage of the kinome,
                 X-React(KIN) relies solely on the predicted target structures
                 and employs state-of-the-art modeling techniques. Benchmark
                 tests carried out against available selectivity data from
                 high-throughput kinase profiling experiments demonstrate that,
                 for almost 70\% of the inhibitors, their alternate molecular
                 targets can be effectively identified in the human kinome with
                 a high (>0.5) sensitivity at the expense of a relatively low
                 false positive rate (<0.5). Furthermore, in a case study, we
                 demonstrate how X-React(KIN) can support the development of
                 selective inhibitors by optimizing the selection of kinase
                 targets for small-scale counter-screen experiments. The

                 replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations
                 arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched

                 a really interesting new gene finger domain, and can prevent
                 cell death by binding and inhibiting active caspases, but are

                 that IAP can modulate the cell cycle and signal transduction.
                 The three main factors, IAPs, IAP antagonists, and caspases,
                 are involved in regulating the progress of apoptosis in many

              and epigenetic differences have been charted between normal and
              breast cancer tissues, changes in higher-order chromatin
              organization during tumorigenesis have not been fully explored.
              To probe the differences in higher-order chromatin structure
              between mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells, we performed
              Hi-C analysis on MCF-10A mammary epithelial and MCF-7 breast
              cancer cell lines.RESULTS:Our studies reveal that the small,
              gene-rich chromosomes chr16 through chr22 in the MCF-7 breast
              cancer genome display decreased interaction frequency with each
              other compared to the inter-chromosomal interaction frequency in
              the MCF-10A epithelial cells. Interestingly, this finding is
              associated with a higher occurrence of open compartments on
              chr16-22 in MCF-7 cells. Pathway analysis of the MCF-7
              up-regulated genes located in altered compartment regions on
              chr16-22 reveals pathways related to repression of WNT signaling.
              There are also differences in intra-chromosomal interactions
              between the cell lines; telomeric and sub-telomeric regions in
              the MCF-10A cells display more frequent interactions than are
              observed in the MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSIONS:We show evidence of an
              intricate relationship between chromosomal organization and gene
              expression between epithelial and breast cancer cells.

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon
                 of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single
                 genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative
                 paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual
                 accumulation of genomic changes with a ``one-off''
                 catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with
                 varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus
                 being a large number of locally clustered copy number
                 aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these
                 chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact
                 on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here,
                 we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of
                 more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types.
                 Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome
                 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue
                 tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic
                 context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently
                 occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy
                 number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected
                 chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level
                 pulverization and telomere related events, which would be
                 compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also
                 report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated
                 with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets,
                 this study characterized features associated with genomic
                 aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of
                 ``chromothripsis''-definitions as previously used. While
                 quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in
                 cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological
                 heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns,
                 beyond a well defined ``chromthripsis'' phenomenon.",

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Drug combinations are a promising strategy for
                 combating complex diseases by improving the efficacy and
                 reducing corresponding side effects. Currently, a widely
                 studied problem in pharmacology is to predict effective drug
                 combinations, either through empirically screening in clinic
                 or pure experimental trials. However, the large-scale
                 prediction of drug combination by a systems method is rarely
                 considered. RESULTS: We report a systems pharmacology
                 framework to predict drug combinations (PreDCs) on a
                 computational model, termed probability ensemble approach
                 (PEA), for analysis of both the efficacy and adverse effects
                 of drug combinations. First, a Bayesian network integrating
                 with a similarity algorithm is developed to model the
                 combinations from drug molecular and pharmacological
                 phenotypes, and the predictions are then assessed with both
                 clinical efficacy and adverse effects. It is illustrated that
                 PEA can predict the combination efficacy of drugs spanning
                 different therapeutic classes with high specificity and
                 sensitivity (AUC = 0.90), which was further validated by
                 independent data or new experimental assays. PEA also
                 evaluates the adverse effects (AUC = 0.95) quantitatively and
                 detects the therapeutic indications for drug combinations.
                 Finally, the PreDC database includes 1571 known and 3269
                 predicted optimal combinations as well as their potential side
                 effects and therapeutic indications. AVAILABILITY AND

                 in selecting lead compounds with increased drug-likeness.
                 However, the relationship between physicochemical properties
                 of constituent drugs and the tendency to exhibit drug
                 interaction has not been systematically studied. We assembled
                 physicochemical descriptors for a set of antifungal compounds
                 (``drugs'') previously examined for interaction. Analyzing the
                 relationship between molecular weight, lipophilicity, H-bond
                 donor, and H-bond acceptor values for drugs and their
                 propensity to show pairwise antifungal drug synergy, we found
                 that combinations of two lipophilic drugs had a greater
                 tendency to show drug synergy. We developed a more refined
                 decision tree model that successfully predicted drug synergy
                 in stringent cross-validation tests based on only
                 lipophilicity of drugs. Our predictions achieved a precision
                 of 63\% and allowed successful prediction for 58\% of
                 synergistic drug pairs, suggesting that this phenomenon can
                 extend our understanding for a substantial fraction of
                 synergistic drug interactions. We also generated and analyzed
                 a large-scale synergistic human toxicity network, in which we
                 observed that combinations of lipophilic compounds show a
                 tendency for increased toxicity. Thus, lipophilicity, a simple
                 and easily determined molecular descriptor, is a powerful
                 predictor of drug synergy. It is well established that
                 lipophilic compounds (i) are promiscuous, having many targets
                 in the cell, and (ii) often penetrate into the cell via the
                 cellular membrane by passive diffusion. We discuss the
                 positive relationship between drug lipophilicity and drug
                 synergy in the context of potential drug synergy mechanisms.",

                 treatment of disseminated malignancies for almost 60 y, yet
                 even successful regimens fail to cure many patients. Although
                 their single-drug components are well studied, the mechanisms
                 by which drugs work together in clinical combination regimens
                 are poorly understood. Here, we combine RNAi-based functional
                 signatures with complementary informatics tools to examine
                 drug combinations. This approach seeks to bring to combination
                 therapy what the knowledge of biochemical targets has brought
                 to single-drug therapy and creates a statistical and
                 experimental definition of ``combination drug mechanisms of
                 action.'' We show that certain synergistic drug combinations
                 may act as a more potent version of a single drug. Conversely,
                 unlike these highly synergistic combinations, most drugs
                 average extant single-drug variations in therapeutic response.
                 When combined to form multidrug regimens, averaging
                 combinations form averaging regimens that homogenize genetic
                 variation in mouse models of cancer and in clinical genomics

                 combination mechanisms of action that are independent of

                 significance must rely on computational inferences in the
                 absence of exhaustive experimental measurements. Here we
                 analyzed the efficacy of these inferences in 33 de novo
                 missense mutations revealed by sequencing in first-generation
                 progeny of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-treated mice, involving 23
                 essential immune system genes. PolyPhen2, SIFT,
                 MutationAssessor, Panther, CADD, and Condel were used to
                 predict each mutation's functional importance, whereas the
                 actual effect was measured by breeding and testing homozygotes
                 for the expected in vivo loss-of-function phenotype. Only 20\%
                 of mutations predicted to be deleterious by PolyPhen2 (and
                 15\% by CADD) showed a discernible phenotype in individual
                 homozygotes. Half of all possible missense mutations in the
                 same 23 immune genes were predicted to be deleterious, and
                 most of these appear to become subject to purifying selection
                 because few persist between separate mouse substrains,
                 rodents, or primates. Because defects in immune genes could be
                 phenotypically masked in vivo by compensation and environment,
                 we compared inferences by the same tools with the in vitro
                 phenotype of all 2,314 possible missense variants in TP53;
                 42\% of mutations predicted by PolyPhen2 to be deleterious
                 (and 45\% by CADD) had little measurable consequence for
                 TP53-promoted transcription. We conclude that for de novo or
                 low-frequency missense mutations found by genome sequencing,
                 half those inferred as deleterious correspond to nearly
                 neutral mutations that have little impact on the clinical
                 phenotype of individual cases but will nevertheless become

                 the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development
                 of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first
                 generation of hash table-based methods has been developed,
                 including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough
                 to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ
                 does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which
                 makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels
                 may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when
                 the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of
                 individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment
                 tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on
                 backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to
                 efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large
                 reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing
                 mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g.
                 from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from
                 AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data
                 suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ,

                 alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)

                 large numbers of genetic variations and alterations of
                 multiple biological phenomena. Cancer genomics has largely
                 focused on the identification of such genetic alterations and
                 the genes containing them, known as 'cancer genes'. However,
                 the non-functional somatic variations out-number functional
                 variations and remain as a major challenge. Recurrent somatic
                 variations are thought to be cancer drivers but they are
                 present in only a small fraction of patients. METHODS: We
                 performed an extensive analysis of amino acid substitutions
                 (AASs) from 6,861 cancer samples (whole genome or exome
                 sequences) classified into 30 cancer types and performed
                 pathway enrichment analysis. We also studied the overlap
                 between the cancers based on proteins containing harmful AASs
                 and pathways affected by them. RESULTS: We found that only a
                 fraction of AASs (39.88 \%) are harmful even in known cancer
                 genes. In addition, we found that proteins containing harmful
                 AASs in cancers are often centrally located in protein
                 interaction networks. Based on the proteins containing harmful
                 AASs, we identified significantly affected pathways in 28
                 cancer types and indicate that proteins containing harmful
                 AASs can affect pathways despite the frequency of AASs in
                 them. Our cross-cancer overlap analysis showed that it would
                 be more beneficial to identify affected pathways in cancers
                 rather than individual genes and variations. CONCLUSION:
                 Pathways affected by harmful AASs reveal key processes
                 involved in cancer development. Our approach filters out the
                 putative benign AASs thus reducing the list of cancer
                 variations allowing reliable identification of affected
                 pathways. The pathways identified in individual cancer and

                 than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with
                 disease; however, background models for them have not been
                 investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to
                 limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation
                 heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring
                 sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation
                 count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation.
                 Here, we address these issues with a new computational
                 framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a
                 comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling

                 with high-throughput sequencing on 572 KB of human DNA and 668
                 KB of mouse DNA that was unmethylated or methylated in order
                 to investigate the effects of this epigenetic modification on
                 the positioning and stability of nucleosomes. The results
                 demonstrated that a subset of nucleosomes positioned by

                 modification increased the affinity of these sequences for the
                 histone octamer. The features that distinguished these
                 nucleosomes from the bulk of the methylation-insensitive
                 nucleosomes were an increase in the frequency of CpG

                 specific DNA sequences is an initial and crucial step of
                 transcription. In eukaryotes, this process is highly dependent
                 on the local chromatin state, which can be modified by
                 recruiting chromatin remodelers. However, previous studies
                 have focused mainly on nucleosome occupancy around the TF
                 binding sites (TFBSs) of a few specific TFs. Here, we
                 investigated the nucleosome occupancy profiles around
                 computationally inferred binding sites, based on 519 TF
                 binding motifs, in human GM12878 and K562 cells. RESULTS:
                 Although high nucleosome occupancy is intrinsically encoded at
                 TFBSs in vitro, nucleosomes are generally depleted at TFBSs in
                 vivo, and approximately a quarter of TFBSs showed
                 well-positioned in vivo nucleosomes on both sides. RNA
                 polymerase near the transcription start site (TSS) has a large
                 effect on the nucleosome occupancy distribution around the
                 binding sites located within one kilobase to the nearest TSS;
                 fuzzier nucleosome positioning was thus observed around these
                 sites. In addition, in contrast to yeast, repressors, rather
                 than activators, were more likely to bind to nucleosomal DNA
                 in the human cells, and nucleosomes around repressor sites
                 were better positioned in vivo. Genes with repressor sites
                 exhibiting well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides, and
                 genes with activator sites occupied by nucleosomes had
                 significantly lower expression, suggesting that actions of
                 activators and repressors are associated with the nucleosome
                 occupancy around their binding sites. It was also interesting
                 to note that most of the binding sites, which were not in the
                 DNase I-hypersensitive regions, were cell-type specific, and
                 higher in vivo nucleosome occupancy were observed at these
                 binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that RNA
                 polymerase and the functions of bound TFs affected the local
                 nucleosome occupancy around TFBSs, and nucleosome occupancy
                 patterns around TFBSs were associated with the expression

                 enriched with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans
                 and that the occurrence of mutations is closely associated
                 with CpG dinucleotides. We aimed to determine if the chromatin
                 organization is genomic locus specific around SNPs, and if
                 newly occurring mutations are associated with SNPs. RESULTS:
                 Here, we classified SNPs according their loci and investigated
                 chromatin organization in both CD4+ T cell and lymphoblastoid
                 cell in humans. We calculated the SNP frequency around somatic
                 mutations. The results indicated that nucleosome occupancy is
                 different around SNPs sites in different genomic loci. Coding
                 SNPs are mainly enriched at nucleosomes and associated with
                 repressed histone modifications (HMs) and DNA methylation.
                 Contrastingly, intron SNPs occur in nucleosome-depleted
                 regions and lack HMs. Interestingly, risk-associated
                 non-coding SNPs are also enriched at nucleosomes with HMs but
                 associated with low GC-content and low DNA methylation level.
                 The base-transversion allele frequency is significantly low in
                 coding-synonymous SNPs (P < 10⁻¹¹). Another finding is that at
                 the -1 and +1 positions relative to the somatic mutation
                 sites, the SNP frequency was significantly higher (P < 3.2

                 chromatin structure is different around coding SNPs and

                 formation of fusion genes are important drivers of
                 hematological cancers. Although the general requirements for
                 breakage and fusion are fairly well understood, quantitative
                 support for a general mechanism of RCT formation is still
                 lacking. The aim of this paper is to analyze available
                 high-throughput datasets with computational and robust
                 statistical methods, in order to identify genomic hallmarks of
                 translocation partner genes (TPGs). Our results show that
                 fusion genes are generally overexpressed due to increased
                 promoter activity of 5' TPGs and to more stable 3'-UTR regions
                 of 3' TPGs. Furthermore, expression profiling of 5' TPGs and
                 of interaction partners of 3' TPGs indicates that these
                 features can help to explain tissue specificity of
                 hematological translocations. Analysis of protein domains
                 retained in fusion proteins shows that the co-occurrence of
                 specific domain combinations is non-random and that distinct
                 functional classes of fusion proteins tend to be associated
                 with different components of the gene fusion network. This
                 indicates that the configuration of fusion proteins plays an
                 important role in determining which 5' and 3' TPGs will
                 combine in specific fusion genes. It is generally accepted
                 that chromosomal proximity in the nucleus can explain the
                 specific pairing of 5' and 3' TPGS and the recurrence of
                 hematological translocations. Using recently available data
                 for chromosomal contact probabilities (Hi-C) we show that TPGs
                 are preferentially located in early replicated regions and
                 occupy distinct clusters in the nucleus. However, our data
                 suggest that, in general, nuclear position of TPGs in
                 hematological cancers explains neither TPG pairing nor
                 clinical frequency. Taken together, our results support a
                 model in which genomic features related to regulation of
                 expression and replication timing determine the set of
                 candidate genes more likely to be translocated in

                 representing 150 TFs with 7484 TCGA tumor data in 18 cancer
                 types. For efficient and accurate inference on gene regulatory
                 rules across a large number and variety of datasets, we
                 developed an algorithm, RABIT (regression analysis with
                 background integration). In each tumor sample, RABIT tests
                 whether the TF target genes from ChIP-seq show strong
                 differential regulation after controlling for background
                 effect from copy number alteration and DNA methylation. When
                 multiple ChIP-seq profiles are available for a TF, RABIT
                 prioritizes the most relevant ChIP-seq profile in each tumor.
                 In each cancer type, RABIT further tests whether the TF

                 differential expression patterns of its target genes across

                 dis-organization. In fact, for over 140 years it has been

                 Even today, nuclear morphology measures include nuclear size,

                 spatial colocalization of chromosomal breakpoints. The

                 chromosome conformation with collections of 1,533 chromosomal
                 translocations from cancer and germline genomes. We show that

                 cells. Deciphering the molecular determinants of this
                 variation will be aided by the elucidation of distinct types
                 of mutations, as they differ in regional preferences and in
                 associations with genomic features. Chromatin organization
                 contributes to regional variation in mutation rates, but its
                 contribution differs among mutation types. In both germline
                 and somatic mutations, base substitutions are more abundant in
                 regions of closed chromatin, perhaps reflecting error
                 accumulation late in replication. By contrast, a distinctive
                 mutational state with very high levels of insertions and
                 deletions (indels) and substitutions is enriched in regions of
                 open chromatin. These associations indicate an intricate

  abstract = "Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has become a standard method for
              detecting genetic variants in human diseases. Although the
              primary use of WES data has been the identification of single
              nucleotide variations and indels, these data also offer a
              possibility of detecting copy number variations (CNVs) at high
              resolution. However, WES data have uneven read coverage along the
              genome owing to the target capture step, and the development of a
              robust WES-based CNV tool is challenging. Here, we evaluate six
              WES somatic CNV detection tools: ADTEx, CONTRA, Control-FREEC,
              EXCAVATOR, ExomeCNV and Varscan2. Using WES data from 50 kidney
              chromophobe, 50 bladder urothelial carcinoma, and 50 stomach
              adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared
              the CNV calls from the six tools with a reference CNV set that
              was identified by both single nucleotide polymorphism array 6.0
              and whole-genome sequencing data. We found that these algorithms
              gave highly variable results: visual inspection reveals
              significant differences between the WES-based segmentation
              profiles and the reference profile, as well as among the
              WES-based profiles. Using a 50\% overlap criterion, 13-77\% of
              WES CNV calls were covered by CNVs from the reference set, up to
              21\% of the copy gains were called as losses or vice versa, and
              dramatic differences in CNV sizes and CNV numbers were observed.
              Overall, ADTEx and EXCAVATOR had the best performance with
              relatively high precision and sensitivity. We suggest that the
              current algorithms for somatic CNV detection from WES data are
              limited in their performance and that more robust algorithms are
              needed.",

                 causal risk variants within implicated genomic regions remains
                 a major challenge. Here we present a new sequence-based
                 computational method to predict the effect of regulatory

                 impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic
                 contexts and accurately predicts the results of dense

                 Therefore, the successful application of bioinformatics and
                 systems biology methods for analysis of high-throughput data
                 in cancer research heavily depends on availability of global
                 and detailed reconstructions of signalling networks amenable
                 for computational analysis. We present here the Atlas of
                 Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), an interactive and
                 comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms implicated in
                 cancer. The resource includes tools for map navigation,
                 visualization and analysis of molecular data in the context of
                 signalling network maps. Constructing and updating ACSN
                 involves careful manual curation of molecular biology
                 literature and participation of experts in the corresponding
                 fields. The cancer-oriented content of ACSN is completely
                 original and covers major mechanisms involved in cancer
                 progression, including DNA repair, cell survival, apoptosis,
                 cell cycle, EMT and cell motility. Cell signalling mechanisms
                 are depicted in detail, together creating a seamless
                 'geographic-like' map of molecular interactions frequently
                 deregulated in cancer. The map is browsable using NaviCell web
                 interface using the Google Maps engine and semantic zooming
                 principle. The associated web-blog provides a forum for
                 commenting and curating the ACSN content. ACSN allows
                 uploading heterogeneous omics data from users on top of the
                 maps for visualization and performing functional analyses. We
                 suggest several scenarios for ACSN application in cancer
                 research, particularly for visualizing high-throughput data,
                 starting from small interfering RNA-based screening results or
                 mutation frequencies to innovative ways of exploring
                 transcriptomes and phosphoproteomes. Integration and analysis
                 of these data in the context of ACSN may help interpret their
                 biological significance and formulate mechanistic hypotheses.
                 ACSN may also support patient stratification, prediction of
                 treatment response and resistance to cancer drugs, as well as
                 design of novel treatment strategies.",

  abstract    = "Discovering the genetic basis of a Mendelian phenotype
                 establishes a causal link between genotype and phenotype,
                 making possible carrier and population screening and direct
                 diagnosis. Such discoveries also contribute to our knowledge
                 of gene function, gene regulation, development, and biological
                 mechanisms that can be used for developing new therapeutics.
                 As of February 2015, 2,937 genes underlying 4,163 Mendelian
                 phenotypes have been discovered, but the genes underlying
                 ∼50\% (i.e., 3,152) of all known Mendelian phenotypes are
                 still unknown, and many more Mendelian conditions have yet to
                 be recognized. This is a formidable gap in biomedical
                 knowledge. Accordingly, in December 2011, the NIH established
                 the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMGs) to provide the
                 collaborative framework and infrastructure necessary for
                 undertaking large-scale whole-exome sequencing and discovery
                 of the genetic variants responsible for Mendelian phenotypes.
                 In partnership with 529 investigators from 261 institutions in
                 36 countries, the CMGs assessed 18,863 samples from 8,838
                 families representing 579 known and 470 novel Mendelian
                 phenotypes as of January 2015. This collaborative effort has
                 identified 956 genes, including 375 not previously associated
                 with human health, that underlie a Mendelian phenotype. These
                 results provide insight into study design and analytical
                 strategies, identify novel mechanisms of disease, and reveal
                 the extensive clinical variability of Mendelian phenotypes.
                 Discovering the gene underlying every Mendelian phenotype will
                 require tackling challenges such as worldwide ascertainment
                 and phenotypic characterization of families affected by
                 Mendelian conditions, improvement in sequencing and analytical
                 techniques, and pervasive sharing of phenotypic and genomic

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: A signal transduction pathway (STP) is a network
                 of intercellular information flow initiated when extracellular
                 signaling molecules bind to cell-surface receptors. Many
                 aberrant STPs have been associated with various cancers. To
                 develop optimal treatments for cancer patients, it is
                 important to discover which STPs are implicated in a cancer or
                 cancer-subtype. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) makes available
                 gene expression level data on cases and controls in ten
                 different types of cancer including breast cancer, colon
                 adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, kidney renal papillary cell
                 carcinoma, low grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung
                 squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, rectum
                 adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometriod carcinoma.
                 Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) is a software package
                 that analyzes gene expression data to identify whether a
                 pathway is relevant in a given condition. METHODS: We present
                 the results of a study that uses SPIA to investigate all 157
                 signaling pathways in the KEGG PATHWAY database. We analyzed
                 each of the ten cancer types mentioned above separately, and
                 we perform a pan-cancer analysis by grouping the data for all
                 the cancer types. RESULTS: In each analysis several pathways
                 were found to be markedly more significant than all the other
                 pathways. We call them notable. Research has already
                 established a connection between many of these pathways and
                 the corresponding cancer type. However, some of our discovered
                 pathways appear to be new findings. Altogether there were 37
                 notable findings in the separate analyses, 26 of them occurred
                 in 7 pathways. These 7 pathways included the 4 notable
                 pathways discovered in the pan-cancer analysis. So, our
                 results suggest that these 7 pathways account for much of the
                 mechanisms of cancer. Furthermore, by looking at the overlap
                 among pathways, we identified possible regions on the pathways
                 where the aberrant activity is occurring. CONCLUSIONS: We
                 obtained 37 notable findings concerning 18 pathways. Some of
                 them appear to be new discoveries. Furthermore, we identified
                 regions on pathways where the aberrant activity might be
                 occurring. We conclude that our results will prove to be
                 valuable to cancer researchers because they provide many
                 opportunities for laboratory and clinical follow-up studies.",

                 of our history, our heritage, and our identity. Some human

                 hair and eye color, while others are associated with
                 susceptibility to disease or response to drug treatment.
                 Identifying the human variations producing clinically relevant
                 phenotypic changes is critical for providing accurate and
                 personalized diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for diseases.
                 Furthermore, a better understanding of the molecular
                 underpinning of disease can lead to development of new drug
                 targets for precision medicine. Several resources have been
                 designed for collecting and storing human genomic variations
                 in highly structured, easily accessible databases.
                 Unfortunately, a vast amount of information about these
                 genetic variants and their functional and phenotypic
                 associations is currently buried in the literature, only
                 accessible by manual curation or sophisticated text

  abstract    = "DNA damage in somatic cells originates from both environmental
                 and endogenous sources, giving rise to mutations through
                 multiple mechanisms. When these mutations affect the function
                 of critical genes, cancer may ensue. Although identifying
                 genomic subsets of mutated genes may inform therapeutic
                 options, a systematic survey of tumor mutational spectra is
                 required to improve our understanding of the underlying
                 mechanisms of mutagenesis involved in cancer etiology. Recent
                 studies have presented genome-wide sets of somatic mutations
                 as a 96-element vector, a procedure that only captures the
                 immediate neighbors of the mutated nucleotide. Herein, we
                 present a 32 \texttimes{} 12 mutation matrix that captures the
                 nucleotide pattern two nucleotides upstream and downstream of
                 the mutation. A somatic autosomal mutation matrix (SAMM) was
                 constructed from tumor-specific mutations derived from each of
                 909 individual cancer genomes harboring a total of 10,681,843
                 single-base substitutions. In addition, mechanistic template
                 mutation matrices (MTMMs) representing oxidative DNA damage,
                 ultraviolet-induced DNA damage, (5m)CpG deamination, and
                 APOBEC-mediated cytosine mutation, are presented. MTMMs were
                 mapped to the individual tumor SAMMs to determine the maximum
                 contribution of each mutational mechanism to the overall
                 mutation pattern. A Manhattan distance across all SAMM
                 elements between any two tumor genomes was used to determine
                 their relative distance. Employing this metric, 89.5 \% of all
                 tumor genomes were found to have a nearest neighbor from the
                 same tissue of origin. When a distance-dependent 6-nearest
                 neighbor classifier was used, 86.9 \% of all SAMMs were
                 assigned to the correct tissue of origin. Thus, although
                 tumors from different tissues may have similar mutation
                 patterns, their SAMMs often display signatures that are
                 characteristic of specific tissues.",

                 greatly increased the identification of mutations in cancer
                 genomes. However, it remains a significant challenge to
                 identify cancer-driving mutations, since most observed
                 missense changes are neutral passenger mutations. Various
                 computational methods have been developed to predict the
                 effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function and
                 classify mutations as deleterious or benign. These include
                 approaches that rely on evolutionary conservation, structural
                 constraints, or physicochemical attributes of amino acid
                 substitutions. Here we review existing methods and further
                 examine eight tools: SIFT, PolyPhen2, Condel, CHASM, mCluster,
                 logRE, SNAP, and MutationAssessor, with respect to their
                 coverage, accuracy, availability and dependence on other
                 tools. RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms with high
                 minor allele frequencies were used as a negative (neutral) set
                 for testing, and recurrent mutations from the COSMIC database
                 as well as novel recurrent somatic mutations identified in
                 very recent cancer studies were used as positive (non-neutral)
                 sets. Conservation-based methods generally had moderately high
                 accuracy in distinguishing neutral from deleterious mutations,
                 whereas the performance of machine learning based predictors
                 with comprehensive feature spaces varied between assessments
                 using different positive sets. MutationAssessor consistently
                 provided the highest accuracies. For certain combinations
                 metapredictors slightly improved the performance of included
                 individual methods, but did not outperform MutationAssessor as
                 stand-alone tool. CONCLUSIONS: Our independent assessment of
                 existing tools reveals various performance disparities.
                 Cancer-trained methods did not improve upon more general
                 predictors. No method or combination of methods exceeds 81\%
                 accuracy, indicating there is still significant room for
                 improvement for driver mutation prediction, and perhaps more
                 sophisticated feature integration is needed to develop a more

                 identify the likely pathogenic mutations that are worth
                 exploring experimentally and clinically are required. We
                 sought to compare the performance of 15 mutation effect
                 prediction algorithms and their agreement. As a
                 hypothesis-generating aim, we sought to define whether
                 combinations of prediction algorithms would improve the
                 functional effect predictions of specific mutations. RESULTS:
                 Literature and database mining of single nucleotide variants
                 (SNVs) affecting 15 cancer genes was performed to identify
                 mutations supported by functional evidence or hereditary
                 disease association to be classified either as non-neutral (n
                 = 849) or neutral (n = 140) with respect to their impact on
                 protein function. These SNVs were employed to test the
                 performance of 15 mutation effect prediction algorithms. The
                 accuracy of the prediction algorithms varies considerably.
                 Although all algorithms perform consistently well in terms of
                 positive predictive value, their negative predictive value
                 varies substantially. Cancer-specific mutation effect
                 predictors display no-to-almost perfect agreement in their
                 predictions of these SNVs, whereas the non-cancer-specific
                 predictors showed no-to-moderate agreement. Combinations of
                 predictors modestly improve accuracy and significantly improve
                 negative predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: The information
                 provided by mutation effect predictors is not equivalent. No
                 algorithm is able to predict sufficiently accurately SNVs that
                 should be taken forward for experimental or clinical testing.
                 Combining algorithms aggregates orthogonal information and may
                 result in improvements in the negative predictive value of
                 mutation effect predictions.",

                 all or a subset of tumor cells will likely be required to
                 improve drug development and precision medicine strategies. We
                 analyzed nine cancer types to determine the subclonal
                 frequencies of driver events, to time mutational processes
                 during cancer evolution, and to identify drivers of subclonal
                 expansions. Although mutations in known driver genes typically
                 occurred early in cancer evolution, we also identified later
                 subclonal ``actionable'' mutations, including BRAF (V600E),
                 IDH1 (R132H), PIK3CA (E545K), EGFR (L858R), and KRAS (G12D),
                 which may compromise the efficacy of targeted therapy
                 approaches. More than 20\% of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas,
                 and 15\% of mutations in genes in the PI3K
                 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of
                 rapamycin) signaling axis across all tumor types were
                 subclonal. Mutations in the RAS-MEK (mitogen-activated protein
                 kinase kinase) signaling axis were less likely to be subclonal
                 than mutations in genes associated with PI3K-AKT-mTOR
                 signaling. Analysis of late mutations revealed a link between
                 APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and the acquisition of subclonal
                 driver mutations and uncovered putative cancer genes involved
                 in subclonal expansions, including CTNNA2 and ATXN1. Our
                 results provide a pan-cancer census of driver events within
                 the context of intratumor heterogeneity and reveal patterns of
                 tumor evolution across cancers. The frequent presence of
                 subclonal driver mutations suggests the need to stratify
                 targeted therapy response according to the proportion of tumor
                 cells in which the driver is identified.",

                 (TCGA) for 436 patients from 8 cancer subtypes with ENCODE and

                 Using a new method that adjusts for sample- and genomic
                 locus-specific mutation rates, we identify recurrently mutated
                 sites across individuals with cancer. Mutated regulatory sites
                 include known sites in the TERT promoter and many new sites,

  abstract    = "To assess factors influencing the success of whole-genome
                 sequencing for mainstream clinical diagnosis, we sequenced 217
                 individuals from 156 independent cases or families across a
                 broad spectrum of disorders in whom previous screening had
                 identified no pathogenic variants. We quantified the number of
                 candidate variants identified using different strategies for
                 variant calling, filtering, annotation and prioritization. We
                 found that jointly calling variants across samples, filtering
                 against both local and external databases, deploying multiple
                 annotation tools and using familial transmission above
                 biological plausibility contributed to accuracy. Overall, we
                 identified disease-causing variants in 21\% of cases, with the
                 proportion increasing to 34\% (23/68) for mendelian disorders
                 and 57\% (8/14) in family trios. We also discovered 32
                 potentially clinically actionable variants in 18 genes
                 unrelated to the referral disorder, although only 4 were
                 ultimately considered reportable. Our results demonstrate the
                 value of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but
                 also highlight many outstanding challenges.",

  abstract    = "Herein we provide a detailed molecular analysis of the spatial
                 heterogeneity of clinically localized, multifocal prostate
                 cancer to delineate new oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We
                 initially determined the copy number aberration (CNA) profiles
                 of 74 patients with index tumors of Gleason score 7. Of these,
                 5 patients were subjected to whole-genome sequencing using DNA
                 quantities achievable in diagnostic biopsies, with detailed
                 spatial sampling of 23 distinct tumor regions to assess
                 intraprostatic heterogeneity in focal genomics. Multifocal
                 tumors are highly heterogeneous for single-nucleotide variants
                 (SNVs), CNAs and genomic rearrangements. We identified and
                 validated a new recurrent amplification of MYCL, which is
                 associated with TP53 deletion and unique profiles of DNA
                 damage and transcriptional dysregulation. Moreover, we
                 demonstrate divergent tumor evolution in multifocal cancer
                 and, in some cases, tumors of independent clonal origin. These
                 data represent the first systematic relation of intraprostatic
                 genomic heterogeneity to predicted clinical outcome and inform

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The use of the knowledge produced by sciences to
                 promote human health is the main goal of translational
                 medicine. To make it feasible we need computational methods to
                 handle the large amount of information that arises from bench
                 to bedside and to deal with its heterogeneity. A computational
                 challenge that must be faced is to promote the integration of
                 clinical, socio-demographic and biological data. In this
                 effort, ontologies play an essential role as a powerful
                 artifact for knowledge representation. Chado is a modular
                 ontology-oriented database model that gained popularity due to
                 its robustness and flexibility as a generic platform to store
                 biological data; however it lacks supporting representation of
                 clinical and socio-demographic information. RESULTS: We have
                 implemented an extension of Chado - the Clinical Module - to
                 allow the representation of this kind of information. Our
                 approach consists of a framework for data integration through
                 the use of a common reference ontology. The design of this
                 framework has four levels: data level, to store the data;
                 semantic level, to integrate and standardize the data by the
                 use of ontologies; application level, to manage clinical
                 databases, ontologies and data integration process; and web
                 interface level, to allow interaction between the user and the
                 system. The clinical module was built based on the
                 Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model. We also proposed a
                 methodology to migrate data from legacy clinical databases to
                 the integrative framework. A Chado instance was initialized
                 using a relational database management system. The Clinical
                 Module was implemented and the framework was loaded using data
                 from a factual clinical research database. Clinical and
                 demographic data as well as biomaterial data were obtained
                 from patients with tumors of head and neck. We implemented the
                 IPTrans tool that is a complete environment for data
                 migration, which comprises: the construction of a model to
                 describe the legacy clinical data, based on an ontology; the
                 Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process to extract
                 the data from the source clinical database and load it in the
                 Clinical Module of Chado; the development of a web tool and a
                 Bridge Layer to adapt the web tool to Chado, as well as other
                 applications. CONCLUSIONS: Open-source computational solutions
                 currently available for translational science does not have a
                 model to represent biomolecular information and also are not
                 integrated with the existing bioinformatics tools. On the
                 other hand, existing genomic data models do not represent
                 clinical patient data. A framework was developed to support
                 translational research by integrating biomolecular information
                 coming from different ``omics'' technologies with patient's
                 clinical and socio-demographic data. This framework should
                 present some features: flexibility, compression and
                 robustness. The experiments accomplished from a use case
                 demonstrated that the proposed system meets requirements of
                 flexibility and robustness, leading to the desired
                 integration. The Clinical Module can be accessed in

                 practice and pharmaceutical drug discovery. RESULTS: We
                 developed the Translational Medicine Ontology (TMO) as a

                 such a knowledge base can aid physicians in providing tailored

                 and of tumor-derived cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line
                 Encyclopedia, as well as the availability of integrated
                 pathway information systems, such as Pathway Commons, to
                 systematically search for a comprehensive set of such
                 epistatic vulnerabilities. RESULTS: Based on homozygous
                 deletions affecting metabolic enzymes in 16 TCGA cancer
                 studies and 972 cancer cell lines, we identified 4104
                 candidate metabolic vulnerabilities present in 1019 tumor
                 samples and 482 cell lines. Up to 44\% of these
                 vulnerabilities can be targeted with at least one Food and
                 Drug Administration-approved drug. We suggest focused
                 experiments to test these vulnerabilities and clinical trials
                 based on personalized genomic profiles of those that pass
                 preclinical filters. We conclude that genomic profiling will
                 in the future provide a promising basis for network
                 pharmacology of epistatic vulnerabilities as a promising
                 therapeutic strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A
                 web-based tool for exploring all vulnerabilities and their
                 details is available at
                 http://cbio.mskcc.org/cancergenomics/statius/ along with

                 components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the three organisms
                 have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture
                 and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for
                 example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single
                 centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed
                 heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal
                 chromosomal 'arms', and centromeres distributed along their
                 lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization
                 and associated gene regulation across species, we generated
                 and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data
                 sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and
                 human. Here we present over 800 new data sets from our ENCODE

                 approaches, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Project was
                 launched to contribute maps of RNA transcripts,
                 transcriptional regulator binding sites, and chromatin states
                 in many cell types. The resulting genome-wide data reveal
                 sites of biochemical activity with high positional resolution

                 provide a rich new source of data for uncovering these
                 subtypes but have proven difficult to compare, as two tumors
                 rarely share the same mutations. Here we introduce
                 network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate
                 somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows
                 for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by
                 clustering together patients with mutations in similar network
                 regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung
                 cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue,
                 NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical
                 outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or
                 tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of

  abstract    = "Cancer is a disease potentiated by mutations in somatic cells.
                 Cancer mutations are not distributed uniformly along the human
                 genome. Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to
                 fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations,
                 posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in
                 cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as
                 a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape.
                 However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are
                 highly cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of
                 mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer
                 types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic
                 features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and
                 modification, together with replication timing, explain up to
                 86\% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes.
                 The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are
                 epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of
                 origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that
                 cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger
                 determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin
                 features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show
                 that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately
                 determined based on the distribution of mutations along its
                 genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses
                 a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic
                 features of its cell of origin.",

  abstract    = "Genomic analyses promise to improve tumor characterization to
                 optimize personalized treatment for patients with
                 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Exome sequencing analysis of
                 243 liver tumors identified mutational signatures associated
                 with specific risk factors, mainly combined alcohol and
                 tobacco consumption and exposure to aflatoxin B1. We
                 identified 161 putative driver genes associated with 11
                 recurrently altered pathways. Associations of mutations
                 defined 3 groups of genes related to risk factors and centered
                 on CTNNB1 (alcohol), TP53 (hepatitis B virus, HBV) and AXIN1.
                 Analyses according to tumor stage progression identified TERT
                 promoter mutation as an early event, whereas FGF3, FGF4, FGF19
                 or CCND1 amplification and TP53 and CDKN2A alterations
                 appeared at more advanced stages in aggressive tumors. In 28\%
                 of the tumors, we identified genetic alterations potentially
                 targetable by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
                 drugs. In conclusion, we identified risk factor-specific
                 mutational signatures and defined the extensive landscape of
                 altered genes and pathways in HCC, which will be useful to
                 design clinical trials for targeted therapy.",

                 kidney cancer subtypes, we analyzed exome, transcriptome and
                 copy number alteration data from 167 primary human tumors that
                 included renal oncocytomas and non-clear cell renal cell
                 carcinomas (nccRCCs), consisting of papillary (pRCC),
                 chromophobe (chRCC) and translocation (tRCC) subtypes. We
                 identified ten significantly mutated genes in pRCC, including
                 MET, NF2, SLC5A3, PNKD and CPQ. MET mutations occurred in 15\%
                 (10/65) of pRCC samples and included previously unreported
                 recurrent activating mutations. In chRCC, we found TP53, PTEN,
                 FAAH2, PDHB, PDXDC1 and ZNF765 to be significantly mutated.
                 Gene expression analysis identified a five-gene set that
                 enabled the molecular classification of chRCC, renal
                 oncocytoma and pRCC. Using RNA sequencing, we identified
                 previously unreported gene fusions, including ACTG1-MITF
                 fusion. Ectopic expression of the ACTG1-MITF fusion led to
                 cellular transformation and induced the expression of
                 downstream target genes. Finally, we observed upregulation of
                 the anti-apoptotic factor BIRC7 in MiTF-high RCC tumors,

  abstract    = "Just as reference genome sequences revolutionized human
                 genetics, reference maps of interactome networks will be
                 critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships.
                 Here, we describe a systematic map of ?14,000 high-quality
                 human binary protein-protein interactions. At equal quality,
                 this map is ?30\% larger than what is available from
                 small-scale studies published in the literature in the last
                 few decades. While currently available information is highly
                 biased and only covers a relatively small portion of the
                 proteome, our systematic map appears strikingly more
                 homogeneous, revealing a ``broader'' human interactome network
                 than currently appreciated. The map also uncovers significant
                 interconnectivity between known and candidate cancer gene
                 products, providing unbiased evidence for an expanded
                 functional cancer landscape, while demonstrating how
                 high-quality interactome models will help ``connect the dots''
                 of the genomic revolution.",

  abstract    = "Identifying driver mutations and their functional consequences
                 is critical to our understanding of cancer. Towards this goal,
                 and because domains are the functional units of a protein, we
                 explored the protein domain-level landscape of
                 cancer-type-specific somatic mutations. Specifically, we
                 systematically examined tumor genomes from 21 cancer types to
                 identify domains with high mutational density in specific
                 tissues, the positions of mutational hotspots within these
                 domains, and the functional and structural context where
                 possible. While hotspots corresponding to specific
                 gain-of-function mutations are expected for oncoproteins, we
                 found that tumor suppressor proteins also exhibit strong
                 biases toward being mutated in particular domains. Within
                 domains, however, we observed the expected patterns of
                 mutation, with recurrently mutated positions for oncogenes and
                 evenly distributed mutations for tumor suppressors. For
                 example, we identified both known and new endometrial cancer
                 hotspots in the tyrosine kinase domain of the FGFR2 protein,
                 one of which is also a hotspot in breast cancer, and found new
                 two hotspots in the Immunoglobulin I-set domain in colon
                 cancer. Thus, to prioritize cancer mutations for further
                 functional studies aimed at more precise cancer treatments, we
                 have systematically correlated mutations and cancer types at
                 the protein domain level.",

                 phenotypes, such as gene expression levels, alternative

                 understanding of complex diseases and traits. Furthermore, how
                 inter-individual variation of DNA methylation is associated to
                 gene expression is just starting to be studied. In this study,
                 we use the GenCord cohort of 204 newborn Europeans'
                 lymphoblastoid cell lines, T-cells and fibroblasts derived
                 from umbilical cords. The samples were previously genotyped
                 for 2.5 million SNPs, mRNA-sequenced, and assayed for
                 methylation levels in 482,421 CpG sites. We observe that
                 methylation sites associated to expression levels are enriched
                 in enhancers, gene bodies and CpG island shores. We show that
                 while the correlation between DNA methylation and gene
                 expression can be positive or negative, it is very consistent
                 across cell-types. However, this epigenetic association to
                 gene expression appears more tissue-specific than the genetic
                 effects on gene expression or DNA methylation (observed in
                 both sharing estimations based on P-values and effect size
                 correlations between cell-types). This predominance of genetic
                 effects can also be reflected by the observation that allele
                 specific expression differences between individuals dominate
                 over tissue-specific effects. Additionally, we discover
                 genetic effects on alternative splicing and interestingly, a
                 large amount of DNA methylation correlating to alternative
                 splicing, both in a tissue-specific manner. The locations of
                 the SNPs and methylation sites involved in these associations
                 highlight the participation of promoter proximal and distant
                 regulatory regions on alternative splicing. Overall, our
                 results provide high-resolution analyses showing how genome
                 sequence variation has a broad effect on cellular phenotypes
                 across cell-types, whereas epigenetic factors provide a
                 secondary layer of variation that is more tissue-specific.
                 Furthermore, the details of how this tissue-specificity may
                 vary across inter-relations of molecular traits, and where

                 regions of genes can impact gene expression. With the advent
                 of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), it has become possible to
                 begin cataloging these noncoding variants. Evidence continues
                 to accumulate linking clinical cases with cis-regulatory
                 element disruption in a wide range of diseases. Identifying
                 variants is becoming routine, but assessing their impact on
                 regulation remains challenging. Bioinformatics approaches that
                 identify variations functionally altering transcription factor
                 (TF) binding are increasingly important for meeting this
                 challenge. We present the current state of computational tools
                 and resources for identifying the genomic regulatory
                 components (cis-regulatory regions and TF binding sites,
                 TFBSs) controlling gene transcriptional regulation. We review
                 how such approaches can be used to interpret the potential
                 disease causality of point mutations and small insertions or
                 deletions. We hope this will motivate further the development

                 of genetic variation and its association with human disease,
                 but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address
                 this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated
                 the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary
                 cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis
                 of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the
                 programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA
                 accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We
                 establish global maps of regulatory elements, define
                 regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely
                 activators and repressors. We show that disease- and
                 trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in
                 tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically
                 relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a
                 resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human
                 disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Cancers result from the accumulation of somatic
                 mutations, and their properties are thought to reflect the sum
                 of these mutations. However, little is known about the effect
                 of the order in which mutations are acquired. METHODS: We
                 determined mutation order in patients with myeloproliferative
                 neoplasms by genotyping hematopoietic colonies or by means of
                 next-generation sequencing. Stem cells and progenitor cells
                 were isolated to study the effect of mutation order on mature
                 and immature hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: The age at which a
                 patient presented with a myeloproliferative neoplasm,
                 acquisition of JAK2 V617F homozygosity, and the balance of
                 immature progenitors were all influenced by mutation order. As
                 compared with patients in whom the TET2 mutation was acquired
                 first (hereafter referred to as ``TET2-first patients''),
                 patients in whom the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation was
                 acquired first (``JAK2-first patients'') had a greater
                 likelihood of presenting with polycythemia vera than with
                 essential thrombocythemia, an increased risk of thrombosis,
                 and an increased sensitivity of JAK2-mutant progenitors to
                 ruxolitinib in vitro. Mutation order influenced the
                 proliferative response to JAK2 V617F and the capacity of
                 double-mutant hematopoietic cells and progenitor cells to
                 generate colony-forming cells. Moreover, the hematopoietic
                 stem-and-progenitor-cell compartment was dominated by TET2
                 single-mutant cells in TET2-first patients but by JAK2-TET2
                 double-mutant cells in JAK2-first patients. Prior mutation of
                 TET2 altered the transcriptional consequences of JAK2 V617F in
                 a cell-intrinsic manner and prevented JAK2 V617F from
                 up-regulating genes associated with proliferation.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The order in which JAK2 and TET2 mutations were
                 acquired influenced clinical features, the response to
                 targeted therapy, the biology of stem and progenitor cells,
                 and clonal evolution in patients with myeloproliferative

                 of in silico tools have been employed for the task of

                 an important practical question to answer is which of these

                 pathogenic character of new variants. We here demonstrate in a

                 is challenging. The functional effect of protein-coding
                 variants is often predicted using sequence conservation and
                 population frequency data, however other factors are likely
                 relevant. We hypothesized that variants in protein
                 post-translational modification (PTM) sites contribute to
                 phenotype variation and disease. We analyzed fraction of rare
                 variants and non-synonymous to synonymous variant ratio
                 (Ka/Ks) in 7,500 human genomes and found a significant
                 negative selection signal in PTM regions independent of six
                 factors, including conservation, codon usage, and GC-content,
                 that is widely distributed across tissue-specific genes and
                 function classes. PTM regions are also enriched in known
                 disease mutations, suggesting that PTM variation is more
                 likely deleterious. PTM constraint also affects flanking
                 sequence around modified residues and increases around
                 clustered sites, indicating presence of functionally important
                 short linear motifs. Using target site motifs of 124 kinases,
                 we predict that at least ∼180,000 motif-breaker amino acid
                 residues that disrupt PTM sites when substituted, and
                 highlight kinase motifs that show specific negative selection

                 with corresponding hypothesized mechanisms as a community
                 resource. As an example of our integrative approach, we
                 propose that PTPN11 variants in Noonan syndrome aberrantly
                 activate the protein by disrupting an uncharacterized cluster
                 of phosphorylation sites. Further, as PTMs are molecular
                 switches that are modulated by drugs, we study mutated binding
                 sites of PTM enzymes in disease genes and define a
                 drug-disease network containing 413 novel predicted

                 and quantification of frequencies of somatic single nucleotide
                 variants (SNV) in heterogeneous tumor cell populations. In
                 some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency
                 of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample
                 can be reconstructed from these SNV frequency measurements.
                 But automated methods to do this reconstruction are not
                 available and the conditions under which reconstruction is
                 possible have not been described. RESULTS: We describe the
                 conditions under which the evolutionary history can be
                 uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or
                 multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a
                 new statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and
                 genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the
                 population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric
                 prior over trees that groups SNVs into major subclonal
                 lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages
                 and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior
                 distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and
                 cell population frequencies that have the highest probability
                 of generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple
                 phylogenies are consistent with a given set of SNV
                 frequencies, PhyloSub represents the uncertainty in the tumor
                 phylogeny using a ``partial order plot''. Experiments on a
                 simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor
                 samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic
                 leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both
                 linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences
                 are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is
                 available. CONCLUSIONS: PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies
                 of any ``binary'' somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as
                 small insertions and deletions. The PhyloSub and partial order

                 in cancer, a rare exception being the recent identification of
                 activating mutations in TERT regulatory DNA. Although this
                 finding is suggestive of a general mechanism for oncogene
                 activation, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we map
                 somatic mutations in 505 tumor genomes across 14 cancer types
                 and systematically screen for associations between mutations
                 in regulatory regions and RNA-level changes. We identify
                 recurrent promoter mutations in several genes but find that
                 TERT mutations are exceptional in showing a strong and
                 genome-wide significant association with increased expression.
                 Detailed analysis of TERT across cancers shows that the
                 strength of this association is highly variable and is
                 strongest in copy number-stable cancers such as thyroid
                 carcinoma. We additionally propose that TERT promoter
                 mutations control expression of the nearby gene CLPTM1L. Our
                 analysis provides a detailed pan-cancer view of TERT

                 may have an impact on pre-mRNA splicing. The major limitation
                 of the application of these tools to basic research and
                 clinical practice is the difficulty in interpreting the
                 output. Most tools only predict potential splice sites given a
                 DNA sequence without measuring splicing signal changes caused
                 by a variant. Another limitation is the lack of large-scale
                 evaluation studies of these tools. We compared eight in silico
                 tools on 2959 single nucleotide variants within splicing
                 consensus regions (scSNVs) using receiver operating
                 characteristic analysis. The Position Weight Matrix model and
                 MaxEntScan outperformed other methods. Two ensemble learning
                 methods, adaptive boosting and random forests, were used to
                 construct models that take advantage of individual methods.
                 Both models further improved prediction, with outputs of
                 directly interpretable prediction scores. We applied our
                 ensemble scores to scSNVs from the Catalogue of Somatic
                 Mutations in Cancer database. Analysis showed that predicted
                 splice-altering scSNVs are enriched in recurrent scSNVs and
                 known cancer genes. We pre-computed our ensemble scores for
                 all potential scSNVs across the human genome, providing a
                 whole genome level resource for identifying splice-altering

                 resulting long-tail phenomenon complicates the discovery of
                 genes and pathways that are significantly mutated in cancer.
                 We perform a pan-cancer analysis of mutated networks in 3,281
                 samples from 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas

                 significantly mutated subnetworks that comprise well-known

                 demonstrated extensive genetic heterogeneity between as well
                 as within individual tumors. However, statistical methods for
                 classifying tumors by subtype based on genomic biomarkers
                 generally entail an all-or-none decision, which may be
                 misleading for clinical samples containing a mixture of
                 subtypes and/or normal cell contamination. RESULTS: We have
                 developed a mixed-membership classification model, called
                 glad, that simultaneously learns a sparse biomarker signature
                 for each subtype as well as a distribution over subtypes for
                 each sample. We demonstrate the accuracy of this model on

              for identifying loci under geographically localized positive
              selection, and has the potential to identify loci subject to
              balancing selection. We have previously investigated the pattern
              of genetic differentiation among human populations at 36.8
              million genomic variants to identify sites in the genome showing
              high frequency differences. Here, we extend this dataset to
              include additional variants, survey sites with low levels of
              differentiation, and evaluate the extent to which highly
              differentiated sites are likely to result from selective or other
              processes. RESULTS: We demonstrate that while sites with low
              differentiation represent sampling effects rather than balancing
              selection, sites showing extremely high population
              differentiation are enriched for positive selection events and
              that one half may be the result of classic selective sweeps.
              Among these, we rediscover known examples, where we actually
              identify the established functional SNP, and discover novel
              examples including the genes ABCA12, CALD1 and ZNF804, which we
              speculate may be linked to adaptations in skin, calcium
              metabolism and defense, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identify
              known and many novel candidate regions for geographically

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Recently, a number of large-scale cancer genome
                 sequencing projects have generated a large volume of somatic
                 mutations; however, identifying the functional consequences
                 and roles of somatic mutations in tumorigenesis remains a
                 major challenge. Researchers have identified that protein
                 pocket regions play critical roles in the interaction of
                 proteins with small molecules, enzymes, and nucleic acid. As
                 such, investigating the features of somatic mutations in
                 protein pocket regions provides a promising approach to
                 identifying new genotype-phenotype relationships in cancer.
                 METHODS: In this study, we developed a protein pocket-based
                 computational approach to uncover the functional consequences
                 of somatic mutations in cancer. We mapped 1.2 million somatic
                 mutations across 36 cancer types from the COSMIC database and
                 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) onto the protein pocket regions
                 of over 5,000 protein three-dimensional structures. We further
                 integrated cancer cell line mutation profiles and drug
                 pharmacological data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
                 (CCLE) onto protein pocket regions in order to identify
                 putative biomarkers for anticancer drug responses. RESULTS: We
                 found that genes harboring protein pocket somatic mutations
                 were significantly enriched in cancer driver genes.
                 Furthermore, genes harboring pocket somatic mutations tended
                 to be highly co-expressed in a co-expressed protein
                 interaction network. Using a statistical framework, we
                 identified four putative cancer genes (RWDD1, NCF1, PLEK, and
                 VAV3), whose expression profiles were associated with overall
                 poor survival rates in melanoma, lung, or colorectal cancer
                 patients. Finally, genes harboring protein pocket mutations
                 were more likely to be drug-sensitive or drug-resistant. In a
                 case study, we illustrated that the BAX gene was associated
                 with the sensitivity of three anticancer drugs (midostaurin,
                 vinorelbine, and tipifarnib). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
                 novel insights into the functional consequences of somatic
                 mutations during tumorigenesis and for anticancer drug
                 responses. The computational approach used might be beneficial
                 to the study of somatic mutations in the era of cancer

                 transformative, proliferative and metastatic capabilities. A
                 full understanding of cancer requires learning the dynamics of
                 the cancer evolutionary process. We present here a large-scale
                 analysis of the dynamics of this evolutionary process within
                 tumors, with a focus on breast cancer. We show that the cancer
                 evolutionary process differs greatly from organismal
                 (germline) evolution. Organismal evolution is dominated by
                 purifying selection (that removes mutations that are harmful
                 to fitness). In contrast, in the cancer evolutionary process
                 the dominance of purifying selection is much reduced, allowing
                 for a much easier detection of the signals of positive
                 selection (adaptation). We further show that, as a group,
                 genes that are globally expressed across human tissues show a
                 very strong signal of positive selection within tumors.
                 Indeed, known cancer genes are enriched for global expression
                 patterns. Yet, positive selection is prevalent even on
                 globally expressed genes that have not yet been associated
                 with cancer, suggesting that globally expressed genes are
                 enriched for yet undiscovered cancer related functions. We
                 find that the increased positive selection on globally
                 expressed genes within tumors is not due to their expression
                 in the tissue relevant to the cancer. Rather, such increased
                 adaptation is likely due to globally expressed genes being
                 enriched in important housekeeping and essential functions.
                 Thus, our results suggest that tumor adaptation is most often
                 mediated through somatic changes to those genes that are
                 important for the most basic cellular functions. Together, our
                 analysis reveals the uniqueness of the cancer evolutionary

                 is of fundamental importance for human genetics. After decades

  abstract    = "It has long been known that methylated cytosines deaminate at
                 higher rates than unmodified cytosines and constitute
                 mutational hotspots in mammalian genomes. The repertoire of
                 naturally occurring cytosine modifications, however, extends
                 beyond 5-methylcytosine to include its oxidation derivatives,
                 notably 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The effects of these
                 modifications on sequence evolution are unknown. Here, we
                 combine base-resolution maps of methyl- and
                 hydroxymethylcytosine in human and mouse with population
                 genomic, divergence and somatic mutation data to show that
                 hydroxymethylated and methylated cytosines show distinct
                 patterns of variation and evolution. Surprisingly,
                 hydroxymethylated sites are consistently associated with
                 elevated C to G transversion rates at the level of segregating
                 polymorphisms, fixed substitutions, and somatic mutations in
                 tumors. Controlling for multiple potential confounders, we
                 find derived C to G SNPs to be 1.43-fold (1.22-fold) more
                 common at hydroxymethylated sites compared to methylated sites
                 in human (mouse). Increased C to G rates are evident across
                 diverse functional and sequence contexts and, in cancer
                 genomes, correlate with the expression of Tet enzymes and
                 specific components of the mismatch repair pathway (MSH2,
                 MSH6, and MBD4). Based on these and other observations we
                 suggest that hydroxymethylation is associated with a distinct
                 mutational burden and that the mismatch repair pathway is
                 implicated in causing elevated transversion rates at
                 hydroxymethylated cytosines.",

  abstract    = "The cis-regulatory effects responsible for cancer development
                 have not been as extensively studied as the perturbations of
                 the protein coding genome in tumorigenesis. To better
                 characterize colorectal cancer (CRC) development we conducted
                 an RNA-sequencing experiment of 103 matched tumour and normal
                 colon mucosa samples from Danish CRC patients, 90 of which
                 were germline-genotyped. By investigating allele-specific
                 expression (ASE) we show that the germline genotypes remain
                 important determinants of allelic gene expression in tumours.
                 Using the changes in ASE in matched pairs of samples we
                 discover 71 genes with excess of somatic cis-regulatory
                 effects in CRC, suggesting a cancer driver role. We correlate
                 genotypes and gene expression to identify expression
                 quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and find 1,693 and 948 eQTLs
                 in normal samples and tumours, respectively. We estimate that
                 36\% of the tumour eQTLs are exclusive to CRC and show that
                 this specificity is partially driven by increased expression
                 of specific transcription factors and changes in methylation
                 patterns. We show that tumour-specific eQTLs are more enriched
                 for low CRC genome-wide association study (GWAS) P values than
                 shared eQTLs, which suggests that some of the GWAS variants
                 are tumour specific regulatory variants. Importantly,
                 tumour-specific eQTL genes also accumulate more somatic
                 mutations when compared to the shared eQTL genes, raising the
                 possibility that they constitute germline-derived cancer
                 regulatory drivers. Collectively the integration of genome and
                 the transcriptome reveals a substantial number of putative
                 somatic and germline cis-regulatory cancer changes that may
                 have a role in tumorigenesis.",

                 understanding of the origins, global distribution, and
                 functional consequences of this variation is far from
                 complete. While regulatory variation influencing gene
                 expression has been studied within a handful of populations,
                 the breadth of transcriptome differences across diverse human
                 populations has not been systematically analyzed. To better
                 understand the spectrum of gene expression variation,
                 alternative splicing, and the population genetics of
                 regulatory variation in humans, we have sequenced the genomes,
                 exomes, and transcriptomes of EBV transformed lymphoblastoid
                 cell lines derived from 45 individuals in the Human Genome
                 Diversity Panel (HGDP). The populations sampled span the

                 Namibian San, Mbuti Pygmies of the Democratic Republic of
                 Congo, Algerian Mozabites, Pathan of Pakistan, Cambodians of
                 East Asia, Yakut of Siberia, and Mayans of Mexico. We discover
                 that approximately 25.0\% of the variation in gene expression
                 found amongst individuals can be attributed to population
                 differences. However, we find few genes that are
                 systematically differentially expressed among populations. Of
                 this population-specific variation, 75.5\% is due to
                 expression rather than splicing variability, and we find few
                 genes with strong evidence for differential splicing across
                 populations. Allelic expression analyses indicate that
                 previously mapped common regulatory variants identified in
                 eight populations from the International Haplotype Map Phase 3
                 project have similar effects in our seven sampled HGDP
                 populations, suggesting that the cellular effects of common
                 variants are shared across diverse populations. Together,
                 these results provide a resource for studies analyzing

                 interact with target genes to influence their expression. To
                 test this, we developed Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) which, by
                 incorporating a sequence capture step into a Hi-C protocol,
                 allows high resolution analysis of targeted regions of the
                 genome. We used CHi-C to investigate long range interactions
                 at three breast cancer gene deserts mapping to 2q35, 8q24.21
                 and 9q31.2. We identified interaction peaks between putative
                 regulatory elements ('bait fragments') within the captured
                 regions and 'targets' that included both protein coding genes
                 and long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, over distances of 6.6kb to

                 sample size and statistical tests for sequence-based
                 association studies. It also provides biostatisticians with a
                 platform to fairly compare RV association methods and to
                 validate and assess novel association tests. AVAILABILITY AND

                 highly stable RNAs that can affect gene regulation by binding
                 and preventing microRNAs (miRNAs) from regulating their
                 messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Mammals have thousands of
                 circRNAs with predicted miRNA binding sites, but only two
                 circRNAs have been verified as being actual miRNA sponges. As
                 it is unclear whether these thousands of predicted miRNA
                 binding sites are functional, we investigated whether miRNA
                 seed sites within human circRNAs are under selective pressure.
                 RESULTS: Using SNP data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we
                 found a significant decrease in SNP density at miRNA seed
                 sites compared with flanking sequences and random sites. This
                 decrease was similar to that of miRNA seed sites in 3'
                 untranslated regions, suggesting that many of the predicted
                 miRNA binding sites in circRNAs are functional and under
                 similar selective pressure as miRNA binding sites in mRNAs.

                 complex events that generate SNPs at multiple sites in a
                 single generation. MNMs have the potential to accelerate the
                 pace at which single genes evolve and to confound studies of
                 demography and selection that assume all SNPs arise
                 independently. In this paper, we examine clustered mutations
                 that are segregating in a set of 1092 human genomes,
                 demonstrating that the signature of MNM becomes enriched as
                 large numbers of individuals are sampled. We estimate the
                 percentage of linked SNP pairs that were generated by
                 simultaneous mutation as a function of the distance between
                 affected sites and show that MNMs exhibit a high percentage of
                 transversions relative to transitions, findings that are
                 reproducible in data from multiple sequencing platforms and
                 cannot be attributed to sequencing error. Among tandem
                 mutations that occur simultaneously at adjacent sites, we find
                 an especially skewed distribution of ancestral and derived
                 alleles, with GC → AA, GA → TT, and their reverse complements
                 making up 27\% of the total. These mutations have been
                 previously shown to dominate the spectrum of the error-prone
                 polymerase Pol $\zeta$, suggesting that low-fidelity DNA
                 replication by Pol $\zeta$ is at least partly responsible for
                 the MNMs that are segregating in the human population. We

                 goal. Here, we introduce a new functional impact score (FIS)
                 for amino acid residue changes using evolutionary conservation
                 patterns. The information in these patterns is derived from
                 aligned families and sub-families of sequence homologs within
                 and between species using combinatorial entropy formalism. The
                 score performs well on a large set of human protein mutations
                 in separating disease-associated variants (∼19 200), assumed
                 to be strongly functional, from common polymorphisms (∼35
                 600), assumed to be weakly functional (area under the receiver
                 operating characteristic curve of ∼0.86). In cancer, using

                 These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal
                 samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those
                 genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected
                 by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with
                 cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list
                 of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical
                 methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many
                 implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors
                 and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive
                 false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We
                 show that this problem stems largely from mutational
                 heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology,
                 MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to
                 exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover
                 extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum
                 within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes
                 and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the
                 genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication
                 timing and also with transcriptional activity. By
                 incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses,

                 networks. Perturbations to networks may drive cells to new
                 phenotypic states, for example, tumorigenesis. Identifying how
                 genetic lesions perturb molecular networks is a fundamental
                 challenge. This study used large-scale human interactome data
                 to systematically explore the relationship among network
                 topology, somatic mutation, evolutionary rate, and
                 evolutionary origin of cancer genes. We found the unique
                 network centrality of cancer proteins, which is largely
                 independent of gene essentiality. Cancer genes likely have
                 experienced a lower evolutionary rate and stronger purifying
                 selection than those of noncancer, Mendelian disease, and
                 orphan disease genes. Cancer proteins tend to have ancient
                 histories, likely originated in early metazoan, although they
                 are younger than proteins encoded by Mendelian disease genes,
                 orphan disease genes, and essential genes. We found that the
                 protein evolutionary origin (age) positively correlates with
                 protein connectivity in the human interactome. Furthermore, we
                 investigated the network-attacking perturbations due to
                 somatic mutations identified from 3,268 tumors across 12
                 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We observed a
                 positive correlation between protein connectivity and the
                 number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations, whereas a weaker or
                 insignificant correlation between protein connectivity and the
                 number of synonymous somatic mutations. These observations
                 suggest that somatic mutational network-attacking
                 perturbations to hub genes play an important role in tumor
                 emergence and evolution. Collectively, this work has broad

                 aetiology. Patients with IIH usually suffer from headache and
                 visual disturbances. High intracranial pressure despite normal
                 ventricle size and negative MRI indicate perturbed water flux
                 across cellular membranes, which is provided by the brain
                 water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). IIH could be associated with
                 malfunctioning intracerebral water homeostasis and
                 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption based on functional or
                 regulatory alterations of AQP4. METHODS: Clinical data, blood
                 and CSF samples were collected from 28 patients with IIH.
                 Clinical characteristics were assessed, and a genetic
                 association study was performed by sequencing the AQP4 gene on
                 chromosome 18. Genetic data were compared with 52 healthy
                 controls and matched by age, sex and ethnicity. Chi-square
                 test and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used in the

                 required shunt application. All, except one, had a good visual
                 outcome. The 24 AQP4 gene SNPs showed no association with IIH.

                 investigated from an evolutionary perspective. We describe
                 recent progress in the cataloging of somatic genetic and
                 genomic alterations, and investigate the contributions of
                 germline as well as epigenetic factors to cancer genome
                 evolution. Finally, we outline the challenges facing
                 researchers who investigate the processes driving the

               to the normal cells in the surrounding tissue. These changes are
               often due to chromosomal rearrangements or somatic mutations
               which result in the altered expression or function of proteins
               that regulate transcription. Indeed, recurrent chromosomal
               translocations are hallmarks of human cancers and vary between
               different types of cancer. Recent studies have implicated genome
               organization and the frequency of DNA double strand breaks as
               important factors contributing to the formation of specific
               chromosomal translocations. It has also become increasingly
               clear that nonrandom organization of the genome regulates gene
               expression in a cell type-specific manner. Single nucleotide
               changes in intergenic regions of the genome have been shown to
               affect gene regulation through the formation of chromatin loops.
               Therefore, understanding the interplay between genome
               organization and transcription in normal cell types and its
               perturbations in cancer will provide important insights into the
               causes of tumorigenesis.",

               and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along a
               one-drug-one-target-one-disease paradigm. As a partial

               pharmacogenomics are emerging to exploit the available data and

               structural energetics and dynamics of molecular interactions in

                 group 1 carcinogen that can cause nephrotoxicity and upper
                 urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UTUC). Whole-genome
                 and exome analysis of nine AA-associated UTUCs revealed a
                 strikingly high somatic mutation rate (150 mutations/Mb),
                 exceeding smoking-associated lung cancer (8 mutations/Mb) and
                 ultraviolet radiation-associated melanoma (111 mutations/Mb).
                 The AA-UTUC mutational signature was characterized by A:T to
                 T:A transversions at the sequence motif A[C|T]AGG, located
                 primarily on nontranscribed strands. AA-induced mutations were
                 also significantly enriched at splice sites, suggesting a role
                 for splice-site mutations in UTUC pathogenesis. RNA sequencing
                 of AA-UTUC confirmed a general up-regulation of
                 nonsense-mediated decay machinery components and aberrant
                 splicing events associated with splice-site mutations. We

                 switching back to its cognate template with the primer
                 terminus now having bypassed the damage, and fork
                 rearrangement to a normal configuration. By both genetic and
                 biochemical criteria, bacteriophage T4 catalyzes replication
                 repair with two alternative sets of proteins, one including
                 the gp32 SSB and the gp41 DNA helicase and the other including
                 the UvsX recombinase. In each pathway, synthesis is conducted
                 by the gp43 DNA polymerase. Here we show that defects in gp32,

                 mutation rates generally, but especially for templated

                 palindromic or direct repeats that are either perfect or
                 imperfect. Models of templated mutagenesis require that the
                 primer terminus switches to an ectopic template, but one that
                 yields mutations instead of error-free bypass. We suggest that
                 the proteins that conduct replication repair normally direct a
                 blocked primer strand specifically to the other daughter
                 strand with considerable accuracy, but that strand switching
                 becomes promiscuous when these proteins are mutationally
                 impaired, thus promoting templated mutations.",

                 BRAF V600E mutation.METHODS:We conducted a phase 3 randomized
                 clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675
                 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with
                 the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to
                 receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or
                 dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area
                 intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates
                 of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points
                 included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A
                 final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim
                 analysis after 98 deaths.RESULTS:At 6 months, overall survival
                 was 84\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the
                 vemurafenib group and 64\% (95\% CI, 56 to 73) in the
                 dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall
                 survival and final analysis for progression-free survival,
                 vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63\%
                 in the risk of death and of 74\% in the risk of either death
                 or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001
                 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by
                 an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover
                 from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response
                 rates were 48\% for vemurafenib and 5\% for dacarbazine.
                 Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were

              characteristics of mutagens to actual mutations observed in human
              tumors only indirectly. Now, next-generation sequencing
              technology enables us to observe in detail the DNA-sequence-level
              effects of well-known mutagens, such as ultraviolet radiation and
              tobacco smoke, as well as endogenous mutagenic processes, such as
              those involving activated DNA cytidine deaminases (APOBECs). We
              can also observe the effects of less well-known but potent
              mutagens, including those recently found to be present in some
              herbal remedies. Crucially, we can now tease apart the
              superimposed effects of several mutational exposures and

              development of individual tumors. Here, we review advances in
              detecting these mutation signatures and discuss the implications

              sequenced tumors from diverse cancer types and multiple

              these tumors will bear the signatures of even more diverse

                 unsupervised learning technique that has been applied
                 successfully in several fields, including signal processing,
                 face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF
                 in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract
                 meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene
                 expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and
                 applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and
                 methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on
                 commercial platforms, while those that are freely available
                 typically require programming skills. This limits their use by
                 the wider research community. RESULTS: Our objective is to
                 provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source,
                 easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms,
                 as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test
                 new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package
                 for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code
                 to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify
                 and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF
                 algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the

                 somatic nonsynonymous mutations. DNA damage and deficiency of
                 DNA repair systems are two major forces to cause somatic
                 mutations, marking cancer genomes with specific somatic
                 mutation patterns. Recently, several pan-cancer genome studies
                 revealed more than 20 mutation signatures across multiple
                 cancer types. However, detailed cancer-type specific mutation
                 signatures and their different features within (intra-) and
                 between (inter-) cancer types remain largely unexplored.
                 METHODS: We employed a matrix decomposition algorithm, namely
                 Non-negative Matrix Factorization, to survey the somatic
                 mutations in nine major human cancers, involving a total of
                 ~2100 genomes. RESULTS: Our results revealed 3-5 independent
                 mutational signatures in each cancer, implying that a range of
                 3-5 predominant mutational processes likely underlie each
                 cancer genome. Both mutagen exposure (tobacco and sun) and
                 changes in DNA repair systems (APOBEC family, POLE, and MLH1)

                 genome with an evident mutational signature. We studied the
                 features of several signatures and their combinatory patterns
                 within and across cancers. On one hand, we found each
                 signature may influence a cancer genome with different
                 influential magnitudes even in the same cancer type and the
                 signature-specific load reflects intra-cancer heterogeneity
                 (e.g., the smoking-related signature in lung cancer smokers
                 and never smokers). On the other hand, inter-cancer
                 heterogeneity is characterized by combinatory patterns of

                 subjects focused only on a few genes or were based on low
                 resolution arrays. This implies that information about what we
                 can consider as a normal sperm DNA methylome and whether it is
                 stable among different normozoospermic individuals is still
                 missing. The definition of the DNA methylation profile of
                 normozoospermic men, the entity of inter-individual
                 variability and the epigenetic characterization of
                 quality-fractioned sperm subpopulations in the same subject
                 (intra-individual variability) are relevant for a better
                 understanding of pathological conditions. We addressed these
                 questions by using the high resolution Infinium 450K
                 methylation array and compared normal sperm DNA methylomes
                 against somatic and cancer cells. Our study, based on the
                 largest number of subjects (n = 8) ever considered for such a
                 large number of CpGs (n = 487,517), provided clear evidence
                 for i) a highly conserved DNA methylation profile among
                 normozoospermic subjects; ii) a stable sperm DNA methylation
                 pattern in different quality-fractioned sperm populations of
                 the same individual. The latter finding is particularly
                 relevant if we consider that different quality fractioned
                 sperm subpopulations show differences in their structural
                 features, metabolic and genomic profiles. We demonstrate, for
                 the first time, that DNA methylation in normozoospermic men
                 remains highly uniform regardless the quality of sperm
                 subpopulations. In addition, our analysis provided both

                 methylation variation between and within the germlines of
                 normal males. First, methylated cytosines were mapped using

                 (DM1), and Huntington disease (HD). Major epigenetic variation
                 was detected within samples, since the majority of sperm cells
                 of the same individual exhibited unique DNA methylation
                 profiles. In the interindividual analysis, 41 of 61 pairwise
                 comparisons revealed distinct DNA methylation profiles (P=.036
                 to 6.8 x 10(-14)). Second, a microarray-based epigenetic
                 profiling of the same sperm samples was performed using a
                 12,198-feature CpG island microarray. The microarray analysis
                 has identified numerous DNA methylation-variable positions in
                 the germ cell genome. The largest degree of variation was
                 detected within the promoter CpG islands and pericentromeric

                 somatic variants lie outside coding regions and their role in
                 cancer progression remains to be determined. In order to
                 establish a system to test the functional importance of
                 non-coding somatic variants in cancer, we created a
                 low-passage cell culture of a metastatic melanoma tumor
                 sample. As a foundation for interpreting functional assays, we
                 performed whole-genome sequencing and analysis of this cell
                 culture, the metastatic tumor from which it was derived, and
                 the patient-matched normal genomes. When comparing somatic
                 mutations identified in the cell culture and tissue genomes,
                 we observe concordance at the majority of single nucleotide
                 variants, whereas copy number changes are more variable. To
                 understand the functional impact of non-coding somatic
                 variation, we leveraged functional data generated by the
                 ENCODE Project Consortium. We analyzed regulatory regions
                 derived from multiple different cell types and found that
                 melanocyte-specific regions are among the most depleted for
                 somatic mutation accumulation. Significant depletion in other
                 cell types suggests the metastatic melanoma cells
                 de-differentiated to a more basal regulatory state.
                 Experimental identification of genome-wide regulatory sites in
                 two different melanoma samples supports this observation.
                 Together, these results show that mutation accumulation in
                 metastatic melanoma is nonrandom across the genome and that a
                 de-differentiated regulatory architecture is common among
                 different samples. Our findings enable identification of the

                 types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos, display
                 relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80\% of
                 all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances, we still
                 have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs
                 participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth
                 analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets
                 across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe
                 dynamic regulation for only 21.8\% of autosomal CpGs within a
                 normal developmental context, most of which are distal to
                 transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with
                 gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and
                 transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification
                 of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition,
                 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single
                 nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related
                 diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The
                 results also highlight the general inefficiency of
                 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80\% of the

                 although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state,
                 our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of
                 coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs
                 can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective

                 dataset for amino acid germline mutations in humans. Since the
                 direction of mutation is known, the amino acid exchange matrix
                 generated from the observed nucleotide variants is asymmetric
                 and the mutabilities of the different amino acids are very
                 different. These differences predominantly reflect preferences
                 for nucleotide mutations in the DNA (especially the high
                 mutation rate of the CpG dinucleotide, which makes arginine
                 mutability very much higher than other amino acids) rather
                 than selection imposed by protein structure constraints,
                 although there is evidence for the latter as well. The
                 variants occur predominantly on the surface of proteins
                 (82\%), with a slight preference for sites which are more
                 exposed and less well conserved than random. Mutations to
                 functional residues occur about half as often as expected by
                 chance. The disease-associated amino acid variant
                 distributions in OMIM are radically different from those

                 disease-associated variants preferentially occur in more
                 conserved sites, compared to 1000 Genomes mutations. Many of
                 the amino acid exchange profiles appear to exhibit an
                 anti-correlation, with common exchanges in one dataset being
                 rare in the other. Disease-associated variants exhibit more

                 of tumours of a given type (>20\%), most are mutated at
                 intermediate frequencies (2-20\%). To explore the feasibility
                 of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we
                 analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742
                 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across
                 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis
                 can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour
                 types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not
                 previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer,
                 including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome
                 stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA
                 processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis
                 indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes
                 mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that
                 near-saturation may be achieved with 600-5,000 samples per
                 tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The

                 nucleosomal chromatin is ultimately repackaged by small,
                 highly basic protamines to generate an extremely compact,
                 toroidal chromatin architecture that is critical to normal
                 spermatozoal function. In common with several species,
                 however, the human spermatozoon retains a small proportion of
                 its chromatin packaged in nucleosomes. As nucleosomal
                 chromatin in spermatozoa is structurally more open than
                 protamine-packaged chromatin, we considered it likely to be
                 more accessible to exogenously applied endonucleases.
                 Accordingly, we have used this premise to identify a
                 population of endonuclease-sensitive DNA sequences in human
                 and murine spermatozoa. Our results show unequivocally that,
                 in contrast to the endonuclease-resistant sperm chromatin
                 packaged by protamines, regions of increased endonuclease
                 sensitivity are closely associated with gene regulatory

                 differential packaging of promoters is observed in the
                 spermatozoal chromatin of both mouse and man. These
                 observations imply the existence of epigenetic marks that
                 distinguish gene regulatory regions in male germ cells and
                 prevent their repackaging by protamines during spermiogenesis.
                 The ontology of genes under the control of
                 endonuclease-sensitive regulatory regions implies a role for

                 quantities of different gene transcripts have been shown to be

                 traits characterized by a low odds ratio for any single
                 contributing variant, very few studies have investigated the
                 contribution of splicing variants. The overarching goal of
                 this study is to discover and characterize the role that
                 variants affecting alternative splicing may play in the
                 genetic etiology of complex traits, which include a
                 significant number of the common human diseases. Specifically,
                 we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
                 splicing regulatory elements can be characterized in silico to
                 identify variants affecting splicing, and that these variants
                 may contribute to the etiology of complex diseases as well as
                 the inter-individual variability in the ratios of alternative
                 transcripts. We leverage high-throughput expression profiling
                 to 1) experimentally validate our in silico predictions of
                 skipped exons and 2) characterize the molecular role of
                 intronic genetic variations in alternative splicing events in
                 the context of complex human traits and diseases. We propose
                 that intronic SNPs play a role as genetic regulators within
                 splicing regulatory elements and show that their associated
                 exon skipping events can affect protein domains and structure.
                 We find that SNPs we would predict to affect exon skipping are

                 genome. Whole-genome sequencing currently represents the most
                 comprehensive strategy for variant detection genome-wide but
                 is costly for large sample sizes, and variants detected in
                 noncoding regions remain largely uninterpretable. By contrast,
                 whole-exome sequencing has been widely applied in the
                 identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian
                 disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo
                 mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders. Since whole-exome
                 sequencing focuses upon the entire set of exons in the genome
                 (the exome), it requires additional exome-enrichment steps
                 compared with whole-genome sequencing. Although the
                 availability of multiple commercial exome-enrichment kits has
                 made whole-exome sequencing technically feasible, it has also
                 added to the overall cost. This has led to the emergence of
                 transcriptome (or RNA) sequencing as a potential alternative
                 approach to variant detection within protein coding regions,
                 since the transcriptome of a given tissue represents a
                 quasi-complete set of transcribed genes (mRNAs) and other
                 noncoding RNAs. A further advantage of this approach is that
                 it bypasses the need for exome enrichment. Here we discuss the
                 relative merits and limitations of these approaches as they
                 are applied in the context of variant detection within gene
                 coding regions.",

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Research interests in microRNAs have increased
                 rapidly in the past decade. Many studies have showed that
                 microRNAs have close relationships with various human cancers,
                 and they potentially could be used as cancer indicators in
                 diagnosis or as a suppressor for treatment purposes. There are
                 several databases that contain microRNA-cancer associations
                 predicted by computational methods but few from empirical
                 results. Despite the fact that abundant experiments
                 investigating microRNA expressions in cancer cells have been
                 carried out, the results have remain scattered in the
                 literature. We propose to extract microRNA-cancer associations
                 by text mining and store them in a database called miRCancer.
                 RESULTS: The text mining is based on 75 rules we have
                 constructed, which represent the common sentence structures
                 typically used to state microRNA expressions in cancers. The
                 microRNA-cancer association database, miRCancer, is updated
                 regularly by running the text mining algorithm against PubMed.
                 All miRNA-cancer associations are confirmed manually after
                 automatic extraction. miRCancer currently documents 878
                 relationships between 236 microRNAs and 79 human cancers

                 exposure to AA revealed a remarkably large number of somatic
                 mutations and an unusual mutational signature attributable to

              expression. Interest in this area has further heightened with the
              growing awareness that numerous environmental agents may cause
              mutations in humans. These mutations may lead to metabolic as
              well as neoplastic diseases. Advances during the past 15 years
              have revealed two major classes of mutagenic mechanisms: directly
              induced base mispairing, and misrepair. Alkylating agents for
              instance, generate many different reaction products in DNA, but
              only two of these (O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymine) are

              particular serious challenge to large genomes; it converts
              cytosine to uracil and guanine to an analogue of cytosine. DNA
              lesions that interrupt DNA chain elongation, including many of
              other products of alkylation, often trigger an error-prone
              postreplication repair process. Current evidence suggests that
              this process involves in incorrect insertion of bases into gaps

               method rigorously defined both the starting nucleotide position
               and the direction of synthesis, as well as making the amount of

               of nascent DNA chains. The precise nucleotide locations of
               arrest sites were determined over templates with complementary

               DNA and isolating virions containing either the Watson or Crick
               strand. Results were correlated with the locations of

               and repeated sequences with mirror-image orientation. Two
               classes of DNA synthesis arrest sites were identified, distinct
               in structure but equivalent in activity. Class I sites consisted
               of palindromic sequences that formed a stable hairpin structure
               in solution and arrested DNA polymerase on both complementary
               templates. The polymerase stopped precisely at the base of the
               duplex DNA stem, regardless of the direction from which the

               structure or sequence symmetry elements, and whose complementary

               other SOS-dependent mutagens and with the mutations produced by
               inducing the SOS system in the absence of mutagenic treatment
               indicates that most u.v.-induced base substitutions are
               ``targeted'', resulting from premutational lesions across from
               the site of the mutations. Among base substitutions, both
               transitions and transversions occur, although the most favored
               mutational sites involve G X C----A X T transitions. G X C----A
               X T transitions are induced preferentially at sites of adjacent
               pyrimidines. In one case the conversion of a site from -A-C-A-
               to -T-C-A- results in a 15-fold increase in u.v.-induced C----T
               transitions. Frameshifts at certain sites are well-induced by
               u.v., and the largest hotspot in the I gene involves the loss of
               an (sequence in text) base pair from a (sequence in text)
               sequence. Of 25 frameshifts detected by DNA sequencing, 23
               mutations at seven different sites result from the elimination
               of a single base-pair, and two mutations result from the
               elimination of two base-pairs. No additions were detected. The
               use of a lacI-Z fusion system, which allows direct selection of
               frameshifts of either sign, reveals that throughout the entire
               gene frameshifts that eliminate a single base-pair (-1)
               predominate by a factor of 20 or more over frameshifts that add
               a single base-pair (+1). In one case a two-base-pair elimination
               occurs frequently, resulting in the loss of a -C-T- sequence (on
               one strand), or a -T-C- sequence, from a -C-T-C-T-C-T-C-
               sequence. For both frameshifts and base substitutions, some
               aspect of the larger surrounding sequence beyond the nearest
               neighbors can influence mutation rates by as much as 50-fold,
               thus determining which sites are seen as hotspots. The bearing

              polymerase-gamma (pol-gamma) have been determined. Pol-alpha,
              purified from five different sources, produces mutations
              resulting in loss of alpha-complementation at a frequency of
              0.8-1.6\%/single round of gap-filling DNA synthesis. DNA sequence
              analysis of 420 independent mutants produced by pol-alpha
              demonstrates three classes of errors. The majority of mutations
              result from single base substitutions, while single base
              frameshifts are detected at a lower but substantial frequency.
              Large deletions are also observed, with a frequency and
              specificity suggesting that they too are produced by pol-alpha in
              vitro. In contrast, pol-gamma is more accurate, producing mutants
              at a frequency of 0.3-0.5\%. The specificity of pol-gamma errors
              is also different, since more than 90\% of the mutants result
              from single base substitutions, while frameshift errors are not
              observed at a frequency significantly above background. The
              pol-gamma mutant spectrum also contains deletion mutations (10 of
              179 mutants) presumably resulting from aberrant in vitro
              synthesis. When considered together with previous results using
              pol-beta (Kunkel, T. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5787-5796) the
              relative accuracy of the three classes of purified vertebrate DNA
              polymerases for base substitutions, frameshifts, and deletions is
              in the order gamma greater than alpha greater than beta. These
              data demonstrate a correlation between the accuracy and
              processivity of DNA polymerization. Thus, the most accurate DNA
              polymerase (pol-gamma) also incorporates the most nucleotides per
              association with the primer-template, while the least accurate
              enzyme (pol-beta) is the least processive. This correlation
              exists both for base substitution mutations and for single base
              frameshifts, and is most obvious for minus-one-base frameshifts
              in runs of pyrimidines. In support of this correlation,
              increasing the processivity of pol-beta from 1 to 4-6
              incorporations per association increases the accuracy of in vitro
              DNA synthesis by severalfold. The data imply that the
              processivity of DNA synthesis could be an important factor in
              controlling the levels of spontaneous and perhaps induced

               recombination, leading to substitution mutation. In vivo studies
               have shown that most combinations of base-pair mismatches can be
               accommodated in the DNA double helix, albeit with varying
               efficiencies. Fidelity of replication requires the recognition
               and excision of mismatched bases by proofreading enzymes and
               post-replicative mismatch repair systems. Rates of excision vary
               with the type of mismatch and there is some evidence that these
               are influenced by the nature of the neighbouring sequences.
               However, there is little experimental information about the
               molecular structure of mismatches and their effect on the DNA

              producing one error for every 10,000 bases polymerized. Pol-beta
              is much less accurate, with an error rate of 1/1,500, while
              pol-alpha has an intermediate accuracy of 1/4,000. The relative
              differences in fidelity between the DNA polymerases are strongly
              influenced by the nature of the mispair. For example,
              G(template):dATP mispairs and G:dGTP mispairs are formed with
              about equal frequency by all three classes of DNA polymerases,

              distinct differences in template site preferences as well as

              apparent in proceeding from the least selective to the most
              accurate enzyme results primarily from a decrease in mispair
              formations at template A and T residues and a decrease in
              misinsertion of pyrimidine deoxynucleotides. These data clearly

              modulating base mispair frequencies at the level of insertion. In

              each of the three classes of DNA polymerases at two particular
              sites in the target sequence suggests that some base substitution

              and mismatch formation have been obtained by evaluating the
              partition function of a stack model which allowed for loop
              formation. As a result the mismatches could be classified into
              wobble base pairs (T/G, G/G, C/A, A/A, A/G), open base pairs,
              i.e. permanent loops (T/T, C/T, T/C, C/C), and intermediate or
              weak base pairs (G/T, A/C, G/A). There is no correlation between
              Tm and the biological repair efficiency of X/X1. The structure
              classes, however, as described above show a close correlation:
              Open base pairs show the lowest repair efficiencies, whereas
              mismatches with high repair efficiency always belong to the
              structural class of wobble base pairs. Because of the palindromic
              nearest neighbors of the variation site X/X1, the influence of
              next-nearest neighbor interactions could be detected and be
              estimated to about 1 kJ/mol for one stack.",

              transition enthalpies and free energies for a series of DNA
              oligomers. These predicted values are in excellent agreement with
              the corresponding values determined experimentally. This

                 variety of repeated motifs of 1-10 bases--but may include much
                 larger repeats as well; (2) larger repeat units often include
                 shorter ones within them; (3) long polypyrimidine and poly-CA
                 tracts are often found; and (4) tandem arrangements of closely
                 related motifs are often found. We propose that slipped-strand
                 mispairing events, in concert with unequal crossing-over, can
                 readily account for all of these features. The frequent
                 occurrence of long tandem repeats of particular motifs
                 (polypyrimidine and poly-CA tracts) appears to result from
                 nonrandom patterns of nucleotide substitution. We argue that
                 the intrahelical process of slipped-strand mispairing is much
                 more likely to be the major factor in the initial expansion of
                 short repeated motifs and that, after initial expansion,
                 simple tandem repeats may be predisposed to further expansion
                 by unequal crossing-over or other interhelical events because
                 of their propensity to mispair. Evidence is presented that
                 single-base repeats (the shortest possible motifs) are
                 represented by longer runs in mammalian introns than would be

              diffraction techniques. The final R factor is 18\% with the
              location of 71 water molecules. The oligomer crystallizes in a
              B-DNA-type conformation, with two strands interacting to form a
              dodecamer duplex. The double helix consists of four A X T and six
              G X C Watson-Crick base pairs and two G X T mismatches. The G X T
              pairs adopt a ``wobble'' structure with the thymine projecting
              into the major groove and the guanine into the minor groove. The
              mispairs are accommodated in the normal double helix by small
              adjustments in the conformation of the sugar phosphate backbone.
              A comparison with the isomorphous parent compound containing only
              Watson-Crick base pairs shows that any changes in the structure
              induced by the presence of G X T mispairs are highly localized.
              The global conformation of the duplex is conserved. The G X T
              mismatch has already been studied by x-ray techniques in A and Z
              helices where similar results were found. The geometry of the

              important factor in stabilizing G X T mismatches. A
              characteristic of Watson-Crick paired A X T and G X C bases is
              the pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis in the plane of the base pairs.
              The G X T wobble base pair is pronouncedly asymmetric. This
              asymmetry, coupled with the disposition of functional groups in
              the major and minor grooves, provides a number of features which

                 that are most sensitive for DNA molecules of less than
                 500-1000 bp. The use of molecules in this size range will
                 maximize the signal due to the structural alteration as well
                 as facilitate the construction of DNA sequences of any desired
                 arrangement. I have emphasized three such methods and
                 summarized their strengths and weaknesses; however, their
                 concurrent application to the determination of DNA flexibility
                 provides an important check of self-consistency. These studies
                 have indicated that the persistence length of DNA in buffers
                 of moderate salt concentration is 450-500 A. Synthetic DNA is
                 now readily available, and many procedures for the
                 construction and cloning of DNA molecules of defined length
                 and sequence (107-108a) are in common use. The availability of
                 restriction fragments of precisely defined length has
                 transformed the study of the physical (particularly
                 hydrodynamic) properties of such molecules, since the hitherto
                 pervasive problem of length polydispersity has been
                 eliminated. Sheared, sonicated, or otherwise abused calf
                 thymus (or other) DNAs should no longer be considered
                 acceptable materials for physical studies. Many studies of
                 bending and torsional fluctuations in DNA have been excluded
                 from this discussion because the DNA samples used were not
                 precisely defined. The torsional elastic constant of DNA has
                 been fairly well established as approximately 3.0 x 10(-19)
                 erg-cm, mainly through a combination of elegant theoretical
                 and experimental studies of topoisomer distributions in
                 circular DNA molecules. The other general approach to the
                 determination of the torsional elastic constant, luminescence
                 decay, is still burdened by the poor characterization of the
                 DNA used in many of the experimental studies as well as by
                 some continued theoretical uncertainties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

                 model, which we called dislocation mutagenesis, has been
                 directly tested. Introducing a single, phenotypically silent
                 G----A base change into the template switches the base

                 variation in the rate of nucleotide substitution among DNA
                 regions reflects differential selective constraints. Here we
                 provide evidence for significant variation in mutation rate
                 among regions in the mammalian genome. We show first that
                 substitutions at silent (degenerate) sites in protein-coding
                 genes in mammals seem to be effectively neutral (or nearly so)
                 as they do not occur significantly less frequently than
                 substitutions in pseudogenes. We then show that the rate of
                 silent substitution varies among genes and is correlated with
                 the base composition of genes and their flanking DNA. This
                 implies that the variation in both silent substitution rate

                 differences in the rate and pattern of mutation over regions

                 mutation patterns vary with the timing of replication of
                 different chromosomal regions in the germline. This hypothesis
                 can account for both the origin of isochores in mammalian

                 that the mutational spectrum for spontaneous and induced
                 mutations is not the same and it can furthermore vary
                 considerably between loci. This is illustrated by molecular
                 characterization of spontaneous and ionizing-radiation-induced
                 mutations in mammalian cells. Furthermore changes of the
                 genetic machinery are not limited to those endpoints usually
                 measured in mutational assays, that is, base substitutions,
                 frameshifts, classical chromosomal aberrations and numerical
                 alterations of chromosomes. Additional alterations, of which

                 events and disproportionate replication of DNA giving rise to
                 gene amplifications, and changes of gene expression through
                 methylation of cytosine. There are reasons to believe that
                 these endpoints are of importance in the development of
                 tumors. Amplification of oncogenes is a well-known phenomenon
                 in tumorigenicity and lately mutations by the insertion of

                 Often these alterations are induced by stress and they
                 constitute a manifestation of the dynamics and instability of
                 DNA and the genetic system revealed in recent years. It is of
                 interest in that context that the flow of genetic information

                 due to a high mutation rate from the methylated form of CpG to
                 TpG and CpA. We examine the hypothesis that the 20\% frequency
                 represents an equilibrium between rate of creation of new CpGs
                 and accelerated rate of CpG loss from methylation. Using this

                 CpG deficiency can be explained by mutation from methylated
                 CpG to TpG/CpA at approximately 12 times the normal transition

                 were CG----TG or CG----CA transitions consistent with a
                 chemical model of mutation via methylation-mediated
                 deamination. This represents a 12-fold higher frequency than
                 that predicted from random expectation, confirming that CG
                 dinucleotides are indeed hotspots of mutation causing human
                 genetic disease. However, since CG also appears hypermutable
                 irrespective of methylation-mediated deamination, a second
                 mechanism may also be involved in generating CG mutations. The
                 spectrum of point mutations occurring outwith CG dinucleotides
                 is also non-random, at both the mono- and dinucleotide,
                 levels. An intrinsic bias in clinical detection was excluded
                 since frequencies of specific amino acid substitutions did not
                 correlate with the 'chemical difference' between the amino
                 acids exchanged. Instead, a strong correlation was observed
                 with the mutational spectrum predicted from the experimentally
                 measured mispairing frequencies of vertebrate DNA polymerases
                 alpha and beta in vitro. This correlation appears to be
                 independent of any difference in the efficiency of enzymatic
                 proofreading/mismatch-repair mechanisms but is consistent with
                 a physical model of mutation through nucleotide
                 misincorporation as a result of transient misalignment of
                 bases at the replication fork. This model is further supported
                 by an observed correlation between dinucleotide mutability and
                 stability, possibly because transient misalignment must be
                 stabilized long enough for misincorporation to occur. Since
                 point mutations in human genes causing genetic disease neither
                 arise by random error nor are independent of their local
                 sequence environment, predictive models may be considered. We
                 present a computer model (MUTPRED) based upon empirical data;
                 it is designed to predict the location of point mutations
                 within gene coding regions causing human genetic disease. The
                 mutational spectrum predicted for the human factor IX gene was
                 shown to resemble closely the observed spectrum of point
                 mutations causing haemophilia B. Further, the model was able
                 to predict successfully the rank order of disease prevalence
                 and/or mutation rates associated with various human autosomal
                 dominant and sex-linked recessive conditions. Although still
                 imperfect, this model nevertheless represents an initial
                 attempt to relate the variable prevalence of human genetic
                 disease to the mutability inherent in the nucleotide sequences

                 of the specific internal architectures in globular proteins?
                 We find that any self-avoiding flexible polymer molecule will
                 develop large amounts of secondary structure, helices and
                 parallel and antiparallel sheets, as it is driven to
                 increasing compactness by any force of attraction among the
                 chain monomers. Thus structure formation arises from the
                 severity of steric constraints in compact polymers. This
                 steric principle of organization can account for why short
                 helices are stable in globular proteins, why there are
                 parallel and anti-parallel sheets in proteins, and why weakly
                 unfolded proteins have some secondary structure. On this
                 basis, it should be possible to construct copolymers, not
                 necessarily using amino acids, that can collapse to maximum
                 compactness in incompatible solvents and that should then have
                 structural organization resembling that of proteins.",

                 triphosphates (dNTPs) in DNA polymerization reactions alters
                 base substitution error rates in a predictable way. Less is
                 known about the effects of substrate imbalances on base
                 addition and deletion error rates. Thus, we examined pool bias
                 effects on frameshift fidelity during DNA synthesis catalyzed
                 by replicative DNA polymerases. Imbalanced pools altered the
                 frameshift fidelity of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1
                 reverse transcriptase. Both mutagenic and antimutagenic
                 effects were observed for minus-one, plus-one, and minus-two
                 nucleotide errors, in a highly sequence-specific manner. Most
                 of this specificity can be rationalized by either of two
                 models. One involves frameshifts initiated by pool
                 bias-induced nucleotide misinsertion, and the other involves
                 pool bias-initiated template-primer slippage. Several examples
                 of complex mutations were also recovered more than once in
                 small mutant collections. These contained closely spaced
                 single-base substitution and minus-one base frameshift
                 changes. The two changes occurred at a frequency much higher
                 than predicted if they were generated independently. This
                 suggests that when the polymerase makes one mistake, the
                 probability that it will make a second mistake within the next
                 few incorporations increases significantly. Perturbation of
                 dNTP pools also affected the frameshift fidelity of the
                 replicative yeast DNA polymerase alpha. In reactions
                 containing a low concentration of one dNTP, the error rate
                 increased for one-nucleotide deletions at homopolymeric
                 template nucleotides complementary to the dNTP whose
                 concentration was low. We extended this approach to determine
                 the frameshift fidelity of simian virus 40 origin-dependent
                 semiconservative replication of double-stranded DNA in
                 extracts of human cells. In reactions performed with an equal
                 concentration of all four dNTPs, replication was highly
                 accurate for minus-one-nucleotide errors. However, when the
                 concentration of one dNTP was decreased, the replication error
                 rate increased at complementary, homopolymeric template
                 positions. This response provides an approach for describing
                 frameshift accuracy during replication of the leading and
                 lagging strands.",

                 been obtained directly in this study from differences between
                 a large number of extant primate gene and pseudogene
                 sequences. A total of 3786 mutations were scored in regions
                 where similarities between pseudogene and corresponding gene
                 sequences is greater than or equal to 85\%, comprising
                 approximately 30\% of the pseudogene database of 80,584 bp.
                 The pattern of mutations obtained in this fashion is almost
                 identical to that obtained by Li et al. (1984) using a
                 slightly different, more direct approach and with a smaller
                 database. When mutations were scored, the neighbor pairs on
                 the 5' and 3' sides were also noted, leading to a large 16 x
                 12 matrix of transitions and transversions. Biases of varying
                 magnitude are found in the rates of substitution of the same
                 base pair in different local sequence environments. The
                 overall order for the effect of the 5' neighbor on the rates
                 of substitution mutation of a pyrimidine is A greater than C
                 much greater than T greater than G, and G greater than A
                 greater than T greater than C for the 3' neighbor; where these
                 results represent the average of substitution rates for the
                 complement purine with complement neighbors of bases ordered
                 above. The order for the 3' neighbor is essentially the same
                 for the two transitions and most of the four transversions as
                 well; however, the order for the 5' neighbor is more variable.
                 The overall rate for the C.G----T.A transition is not unusual,
                 however the presence of a 3' neighboring G.C pair boosts the
                 rate substantially, presumably due to specific cytosine
                 methylation of the CG doublet in primate DNAs. The rate of the
                 T.A----C.G transition is also well above average when the 3'
                 neighbor is an A.T, and to a lesser extent a G.C, pair. The
                 latter bias is typical in that it reflects the association of
                 alternating pyrimidine-purine sequences with increasing
                 mutation rates. The substitution of the pyrimidine in a
                 5'purine-pyrimidine-purine3' sequence generally occurs much
                 faster than in a pyrimidine tract and points to the local
                 conformation as a major determining factor of the substitution
                 rate. An apparent inverse relationship is found between
                 starting and product doublet frequencies of base pairs
                 undergoing mutations with specific 3' neighbors, indicating
                 that differences in intrinsic substitution rates of base pairs
                 with specific neighbors are a key factor in producing the
                 familiar biases of nearest-neighbor frequencies.",

                 The target for mutagenesis in these studies was the bacterial
                 gpt gene stably integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the
                 mouse cells. Previous studies in this laboratory had generated
                 a large panel of xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase
                 (EC 2.4.2.22)-negative mutant lines that possess single-base
                 mutations within the gpt coding sequence. This study utilized
                 four xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-negative
                 mutant lines to assess the frequency of mutation induced by
                 thymidine at guanine residues in four sequence contexts: the
                 5' and 3' guanine residues of a GG doublet, the middle guanine
                 residue of a GGG triplet, and the 3' guanine residue of a GGGG

                 of cultured cells with a high concentration of thymidine can
                 result in G.C----A.T transition mutations that occur
                 preferentially at the 3' guanine residue of a run of two or
                 more adjacent guanines. Guanine residues flanked on their 3'
                 side by other guanine residues are severalfold less mutable by
                 thymidine than are guanine residues flanked on their 3' side

                 Hemophilia B is a useful model for studying the underlying
                 pattern of recent germline mutations in humans because the
                 observed pattern of mutation in factor IX more closely
                 reflects the underlying pattern of mutation than the observed
                 pattern for many other genes. In addition, it is possible to
                 identify and correct for biases inherent in ascertaining only
                 those mutations that cause hemophilia. Aspects of the pattern
                 of germline mutation in the factor IX gene are becoming clear:
                 1) in the United States, two-thirds of mutations causing mild
                 disease arose from three founders whereas almost all the
                 mutations resulting in either moderate or severe disease arose
                 independently, generally within the past 150 years; 2) direct
                 estimates of the rates of mutation in humans indicate that
                 transitions are more frequent than transversions, which in
                 turn are more frequent than deletions and insertions; 3)
                 transitions at CpG are elevated approximately 24-fold relative
                 to transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides; 4) transversions at
                 CpG are elevated approximately eightfold relative to
                 transversions at non-CpG dinucleotides; 5) the sum total of
                 the dinucleotide mutation rates produces a bias against G and
                 C bases that would be sufficient to maintain the G+C content
                 of the factor IX gene at its evolutionarily conserved level of
                 40\%; and 6) the pattern of mutation is similar for Caucasians
                 residing in the United States and for Asians residing in Asia.
                 Two ideas emerge from this and from an analysis of the pattern
                 of recent deleterious mutations compared with ancient neutral
                 mutations that have been fixed during evolution into the
                 factor IX gene. First, the bulk of germline mutations are
                 likely to arise from endogenous processes rather than
                 environmental mutagens. Second, the factor IX protein is
                 composed mostly of two classes of amino acids: critical
                 residues in which all single-base missense changes will
                 disrupt protein function, and ``spacer'' residues in which the
                 precise nature of the residue is unimportant but the peptide
                 bond is necessary to keep the critical residues in register.
                 More work is necessary to assess the veracity and generality
                 of these ideas.",

                 in DNA damage and repair are explained. Different types of DNA

                 type of DNA sequence motifs to be preferentially attacked
                 depends upon the chemical or physical nature of the assaulting
                 agent and the DNA base composition. Higher-order chromatin
                 structure, the nonrandom nucleosome positioning along the DNA,
                 the absence of nucleosomes from the promoter regions of active
                 genes, curved DNA, the presence of sequence-specific binding
                 proteins, and the torsional strain on the DNA induced by an
                 increased transcriptional activity all are expected to affect
                 rates of damage of individual genes. Furthermore, potential
                 Z-DNA, H-DNA, slippage, and cruciform structures in the
                 regulatory region of some genes or in other genomic loci
                 induced by torsional strain on the DNA are more prone to
                 modification by genotoxic agents. A specific actively
                 transcribed gene may be preferentially damaged over
                 nontranscribed genes only in specific cell types that maintain
                 this gene in active chromatin fractions because of (1) its
                 decondensed chromatin structure, (2) torsional strain in its
                 DNA, (3) absence of nucleosomes from its regulatory region,
                 and (4) altered nucleosome structure in its coding sequence
                 due to the presence of modified histones and HMG proteins. The
                 situation in this regard of germ cell lineages is, of course,
                 the only one to intervene in evolution. Most lesions in DNA
                 such as those caused by UV or DNA alkylating agents tend to
                 diminish the GC content of genomes. Thus, DNA sequences not
                 bound by selective constraints, such as pseudogenes, will show
                 an increase in their AT content during evolution as evidenced
                 by experimental observations. On the other hand,
                 transcriptionally active parts may be repaired at rates higher
                 than inactive parts of the genome, and proliferating cells may
                 display higher repair activities than quiescent cells. This
                 might arise from a tight coupling of the repair process with
                 both transcription and replication, all these processes taking
                 place on the nuclear matrix. Repair activities differ greatly
                 among species, and there is a good correlation between life
                 span and repair among mammals. It is predicted that genes that
                 are transcriptionally active in germ-cell lineages have a
                 lower mutation rate than bulk DNA, a circumstance that is
                 expected to be reflected in evolution. Exception to this rule

                 fibre diffraction, X-ray crystal structures and gel-running

                 sequence-dependent DNA structure, including polymorphism in
                 DNA, the lack of polymorphism in RNA, the structure of Z-DNA,
                 bistability in pyrimidine-purine (YR) steps, the origin of
                 propeller twist and buckle and the role of TATA sequences at
                 the sites of origin of replication. The computational model
                 used specifically allows for the charge distribution
                 associated with the out-of-plane pi-electron density of the
                 bases. The results obtained are rationalized on the basis of
                 the shapes and charge distributions of the bases. Calladine's
                 cross-strand steric clashes at pyrimidine-purine (YR) and
                 CX/XG steps are reproduced. In AX/XT steps, same-strand steric
                 clashes occur between the thymine methyl group and the
                 5'-neighbouring sugar. They are the cause of the large
                 negative propeller twist observed in A.T base-pairs. Steric

                 Electrostatic interactions between partial atomic charges are
                 most important for C.G base-pairs which are highly polarized.
                 They lead to strong preferences for positive slide and
                 negative slide conformations in CG and GC steps, respectively.
                 This combination can be accommodated in poly(CG) by
                 left-handed Z-DNA. Many of the more subtle sequence-dependent
                 effects are caused by electrostatic interactions between the
                 partial atomic charges on one base-pair and the out-of-plane
                 pi-electron density on another. The effect is most important
                 in CX-XG steps and leads to bistability. In general,
                 electrostatic interactions cause non-zero slide. This is
                 opposed by the hydrophobic effect which favours the zero slide
                 B-type conformation. Thus, B-DNA is observed at high water
                 content in fibres and electrostatic interactions force high or
                 low slide A or C-DNA conformations at low water content. If
                 two juxtaposed steps have very different conformational
                 preferences, this incompatibility can lead to unusual
                 structures such as Z-DNA or strain such as in TATA sequences.",

                 spectrum of the overall genome. This collection of mutants was
                 used to assess the contribution of several mutagenic processes
                 to spontaneous mutagenesis. Deletions and single base pair
                 changes account for the majority of the mutants and arise in
                 approximately equal amounts (43 and 41\%, respectively). The
                 majority of the deletions and insertions are < 5 bp and are
                 likely to be caused by template-directed misalignment
                 (slippage) during replication. To account for frameshifts at
                 non-iterated sites we propose a slightly different
                 template-directed replication error model. A considerable
                 amount of the observed base pair changes can also be explained
                 by this last model, but several other processes leading to
                 base pair changes such as depurination, deamination or
                 spontaneously arising DNA damage are likely to contribute as
                 well. We have compared this spectrum with mutation spectra in
                 the endogenous hprt genes using published mutation data. It is
                 shown that in the endogenous genes the contribution of base
                 pair substitutions is much larger (71\%) than in the hprt cDNA
                 integrates and that deletions are less frequently observed
                 (20\%). The mutation rates of the integrated hprt cDNA genes
                 show a mean increase of 30-fold as compared with the
                 endogenous hprt gene. This results in a 60-fold increase of
                 the absolute rate of deletion in the hprt cDNA genes and in a
                 15-fold increase of the base pair substitution rate.
                 Replication errors such as slippage or the mechanism proposed

                 mutational activity. Studies on the mismatch in four different
                 5' and 3' neighbor contexts indicate that the nature of the 5'
                 base to the thymine of the mispair is probably the single most
                 critical factor in determining the structural features that
                 facilitate or discourage mutations. When cytosine is the 5'
                 neighbor, the helix adopts a mostly BII conformation, whereas
                 a 5' guanine preserves the canonical BI. Structures that vary
                 little from the BI structure on the incorporation of the
                 mismatch have sequences that correspond to lower rates of
                 transition, whereas those with mostly BII conformations, have
                 sequences with high mutation rates. Subtle variations in
                 stacking patterns around the mismatch precipitate a structural
                 Domino-effect, with a variety of changes in conformation. The
                 helix opens at the mismatch with increased roll angle and
                 propeller twist, causing the thymine to migrate into the major
                 groove and the guanine into the minor groove, exposing the

                 eukaryotic cells: one is mispairing, while another is errors
                 in translesion synthesis. The alkylating agent
                 methylnitrosourea causes G:T mispairing; consequently, most
                 mutations it induces are G to A transitions. The second
                 process can occur spontaneously or be caused by exposure to
                 X-rays, Trp-P2, a tryptophan pyrolysate, or
                 acetylaminofluorene. A variety of premutagenic lesions are
                 produced in DNA by these mutagens, but spectra of the
                 mutations resemble each other, especially in the high
                 frequency of deletions at the sites of short direct repeats.
                 The slippage--misalignment mechanism accounted well for the
                 greater part of the observed deletions. A similar spectrum of
                 mutations was observed in the tumor suppressor gene APC from
                 colorectal tumors; about 40\% are deletions at the sites of
                 short repeats. These findings led us to propose that
                 slippage--misalignment is an ubiquitous mechanism of
                 mutagenesis and is responsible for a significant proportion of
                 spontaneous mutations in mammalian cells.",

                 the three species considered here--Drosophila, mouse, and
                 human--and are not related to time, as is often assumed.
                 Spontaneous germline mutation rates per generation averaged
                 among loci are less variable among species than they are among
                 loci and tests and between gender. Mutation rates are highly
                 variable over time in diverse lineages. Recent estimates of
                 the number of germ cell divisions per generation are: for
                 humans, 401 (30-year generation) in males and 31 in females;
                 for mice, 62 (9-month generation) in males and 25 in females;
                 and for Drosophila melanogaster, 35.5 (18-day generation) in
                 males and 36.5 (25-day generation) in females. The
                 relationships between germ cell division estimates of the two
                 sexes in the three species closely reflect those between
                 mutation rates in the sexes, although mutation rates per cell
                 division vary among species. Whereas the overall rate per
                 generation is constant among species, this consistency must be
                 achieved by diverse mechanisms. Modifiers of mutation rates,
                 on which selection might act, include germline characteristics
                 that contribute disproportionately to the total mutation
                 rates. The germline mutation rates between the sexes within a
                 species are largely influenced by germ cell divisions per
                 generation. Also, a large portion of the total mutations occur
                 during the interval between the beginning of meiosis and
                 differentiation of the soma from the germline. Significant
                 genetic events contributing to mutations during this time may
                 include meiosis, lack of DNA repair in sperm cells,
                 methylation of CpG dinucleotides in mammalian sperm and early

                 3 x 10(-6), respectively. The data also suggest that error
                 rates for both the (+) and (-) strands differ by less than
                 2-fold when they are replicated either as the leading or
                 lagging strand. This is in contrast to the 33- and 8-fold
                 differences observed earlier for G.dTTP and C.dTTP mispairs on

                 replication proteins varies with the mispair and sequence
                 considered. Misincorporation of dGTP preferentially occurs at
                 template positions where dGTP is the next correct nucleotide

                 suggests that these replication errors are normally proofread

                 constructing M13 phagemids containing part of the Escherichia
                 coli lacZ gene, in which an opal codon is flanked either by
                 nine adenine-thymine base pairs on each side, or by nine
                 guanine-cytosine pairs, or by its wild-type sequence context.
                 Reversions or pseudoreversions within the opal codon yield a
                 lacZ alpha-peptide that can undergo alpha-complementation and
                 yield a blue plaque when plated with a chromogenic substrate.
                 When these constructs were replicated in HeLa cell extracts,
                 in the presence of equimolar deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate
                 (dNTP) mixtures, reversion was near background levels in both

                 concentrations are mildly but significantly mutagenic, and
                 pool asymmetries and base sequence context both contribute to

                 overlap and additional exchange processes have made detailed

                 We have used NMR to characterise the conformations of four
                 duplexes containing single G.G mismatches, including a nonamer
                 d(CATCGGATG), two undecamers d(GCATTGAATGC) and d(CATGTGACGTG)
                 that can each form a self-complementary duplex with a single
                 G.G mispair in the centre, and the non-self-complementary
                 d(GTAACGACATG).d(CATGTGGTTAC). The three self-complementary
                 duplexes have a single set of NMR resonances, and all four
                 duplexes show evidence of conformational exchange at the
                 mismatch site. The N1H resonances of the mismatched G residues
                 each integrate to two protons, ruling out the enol tautomer.
                 They resonate between 10.5-10.7 ppm, far upfield of the
                 Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded GN1H and exchange readily with
                 water protons. Intraresidue GH8-H1' NOE intensities are
                 two-threefold larger for the mismatched G residues than in G.C
                 base pairs, indicating the presence of syn conformations. NOE
                 time courses for the self-complementary duplexes were
                 consistent with an equimolar mixture of G(syn).G(anti) and G
                 (anti).G(syn) states. By symmetry, these states must be
                 interconverting at a rate that is fast on the chemical shift
                 timescale. In the non-self-complementary undecamer, the NOE
                 data indicated that the distinguishable mismatched G residues
                 also spend a significant, but different, fraction of the time
                 in both the syn and anti conformations. The rate constant for
                 the syn/anti transition in the non-self-complementary
                 undecamer was determined as approximately 14,000 s-1 at 303 K

                 report here the results of a comparative spectroscopic and

                 without the oxidative lesion 2'-deoxy-7-hydro-8-oxoguanosine
                 (8-oxodG). Specifically, we have studied a family of eight
                 13-mer duplexes of the form [5'-GCGTAC[G* or
                 G]CATGCG-3'].[3'-CGCATG[C, A, T, or G]GTACGC-5'] in which G*
                 is the 8-oxodG lesion. These eight duplexes, which we
                 designate by the identity of the variable central base pair
                 (e.g., G*C), reflect two subsets: four duplexes in which the
                 modified guanine base is positioned opposite each of the four
                 possible canonical residues (G*C, G*A, G*G, G*T) and the
                 corresponding four ``control'' duplexes in which the guanine
                 is not modified (GC, GA, GG, GT). The data derived from our
                 spectroscopic and calorimetric measurements on these eight
                 duplexes allow us to evaluate the influence of the 8-oxodG
                 lesion, as well as the base opposite the lesion, on the
                 conformation, the thermal and thermodynamic stability, and the
                 melting thermodynamics of the host DNA duplex. We find that
                 modification of dG to 8-oxodG (G*) does not change the global
                 DNA duplex conformation as judged by circular dichroism
                 spectra. Despite this structural similarity, our data reveal
                 that the dG to dG* modification does influence duplex thermal
                 and thermodynamic properties, some of which depend on the base
                 opposite the lesion. Thus, apparent structural identity does
                 not mean that two duplexes necessarily will exhibit equivalent
                 thermal and/or thermodynamic properties. In general, we find
                 that the thermodynamic effects induced by the lesion (e.g., GC
                 vs G*C) or by mismatched base pairs (e.g., GC vs GG) can
                 result in relatively large changes in enthalpy which are
                 partially or wholly compensated entropically to produce
                 relatively modest changes in free energy. Our data also
                 suggest that the biologically observed differential
                 recognition of 8-oxodG duplexes and the preferential
                 nucleotide insertion opposite 8-oxodG residues cannot be
                 rationalized simply in terms of large thermodynamic

                 mismatches arise when 5-methylcytosine or cytosine deaminate
                 spontaneously (and hydrolytically) in DNA. Substrates were

                 spontaneous, often complex mutational events that correct them
                 to perfect palindromes. Two models that depend on the
                 quasipalindrome providing a template for a specific mutational
                 event have been described to explain this mutation: an
                 intramolecular and an intermolecular strand switch model. A
                 17bp quasipalindrome containing a -1 deletion within the
                 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene in plasmid pJT7
                 undergoes a spontaneous +1 frameshift mutation that creates a
                 perfect inverted repeat and a Cm(r) phenotype. By analyzing
                 this mutation frequency in two plasmids that contain the CAT
                 gene in either orientation with respect to the origin of
                 replication, we show that the specific frameshift occurs
                 preferentially in the leading strand during DNA replication.
                 Due to the availability and proximity of the lagging strand
                 template as a single strand during replication of the
                 quasipalindrome in the leading but not lagging strand, we
                 suggest that the specificity for the leading strand correction
                 is due to a leading strand specific intermolecular strand
                 switch rather than an intramolecular strand switch. To test
                 this hypothesis, we have designed a genetic selection to
                 detect a leading strand intermolecular strand switch. This
                 selection utilizes asymmetric quasipalindromes, one of which
                 contains two central stop codons. When cloned into the CAT
                 gene in pJT7, reversion to Cm(r) requires inversion of the
                 stop codons and addition of a +1 frameshift to correct the
                 reading frame. The inversion of the central stop codons, which
                 is predicted by an intermolecular but not an intramolecular
                 strand switch, occurs concomitant with the specific correction
                 of the original 17 bp quasipalindrome. Inversion of an
                 asymmetric center can also be demonstrated when not under
                 selective pressure using a quasipalindrome lacking central
                 stop codons. These results are consistent with the correction
                 of a quasipalindrome occurring predominantly by an
                 intermolecular strand switch during replication of the leading
                 strand.",

                 splicing enhancers (ESEs) recognized by human SF2/ASF, SRp40,
                 and SRp55, respectively. These ESEs are functional in splicing
                 and are highly specific. For SF2/ASF and SRp55, in most cases,
                 only the cognate SR protein can efficiently recognize an ESE
                 and activate splicing. In contrast, the SRp40-selected ESEs
                 can function with either SRp40 or SRp55, but not with SF2/ASF.
                 UV cross-linking/competition and immunoprecipitation
                 experiments showed that SR proteins recognize their cognate
                 ESEs in nuclear extract by direct and specific binding. A
                 motif search algorithm was used to derive consensus sequences
                 for ESEs recognized by these SR proteins. Each SR protein
                 yielded a distinct 5- to 7-nucleotide degenerate consensus.
                 These three consensus sequences occur at higher frequencies in
                 exons than in introns and may thus help define exon-intron
                 boundaries. They occur in clusters within regions
                 corresponding to naturally occurring, mapped ESEs. We conclude
                 that a remarkably diverse set of sequences can function as
                 ESEs. The degeneracy of these motifs is consistent with the
                 fact that exonic enhancers evolved within extremely diverse
                 protein coding sequences and are recognized by a small number
                 of SR proteins that bind RNA with limited sequence

                 relative sensitivities of these elements to oxidative stress
                 are unknown. In this study these factors were assessed in
                 human spermatozoa exposed to increasing levels of oxidative
                 stress achieved through the stimulation of endogenous oxidant
                 generation with NADPH or direct exposure to hydrogen peroxide.
                 At low levels of oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation was
                 significantly reduced while the rates of sperm-oocyte fusion
                 were significantly enhanced. As the level of oxidative stress
                 increased, the spermatozoa exhibited significantly elevated
                 levels of DNA damage (p < 0.001) and yet continued to express
                 an enhanced capacity for sperm-oocyte fusion. At the highest
                 levels of oxidative stress, extremely high rates of DNA

                 of human spermatozoa depending on the intensity of the

                 different rates, spermatozoa exhibiting significant DNA damage

                 is a major source of the occurrence of promutagenic
                 base-pairing errors during DNA replication or repair.
                 Base-base mismatches or loops of extra bases can arise which,
                 if left unrepaired, will generate point or frameshift
                 mutations respectively. To counteract this mutagenic
                 potential, organisms have developed a number of elaborate
                 surveillance and repair strategies which co-operate to
                 maintain the integrity of their genomes. An important
                 replication-associated correction function is provided by the
                 post-replicative mismatch repair system. This system is highly
                 conserved among species and appears to be the major pathway
                 for strand-specific elimination of base-base mispairs and
                 short insertion/deletion loops (IDLs), not only during DNA
                 replication, but also in intermediates of homologous
                 recombination. The efficiency of repair of different
                 base-pairing errors in the DNA varies, and appears to depend
                 on multiple factors, such as the physical structure of the
                 mismatch and sequence context effects. These structural
                 aspects of mismatch repair are poorly understood. In contrast,
                 remarkable progress in understanding the biochemical role of
                 error-recognition proteins has been made in the recent past.
                 In eukaryotes, two heterodimers consisting of MutS-homologous
                 proteins have been shown to share the function of mismatch
                 recognition in vivo and in vitro. A first MutS homologue,
                 MSH2, is present in both heterodimers, and the specificity for
                 mismatch recognition is dictated by its association with
                 either of two other MutS homologues: MSH6 for recognition of
                 base-base mismatches and small IDLs, or MSH3 for recognition
                 of IDLs only. Mismatch repair deficiency in cells can arise
                 through mutation, transcriptional silencing or as a result of
                 imbalanced expression of these genes.",

                 humans, the mutation rate from 5-methylcytosine (m5C) to
                 thymine (T) is 10-50-fold higher than other transitions and
                 the methylated sequence CpG is consequently under-represented.
                 Over one-third of germline point mutations associated with
                 human genetic disease and many somatic mutations leading to
                 cancer involve loss of CpG. The primary cause of mutability
                 appears to be hydrolytic deamination. Cytosine deamination
                 produces mismatched uracil (U), which can be removed by uracil
                 glycosylase, whereas m5C deamination generates a G x T mispair
                 that cannot be processed by this enzyme. Correction of m5CpG x
                 TpG mismatches may instead be initiated by the thymine DNA

                 mismatches-the primary product of deamination at methyl-CpG.

                 DNA damage provide an understanding of oncogene activation and
                 tumor suppressor gene inactivation, and hence provide an
                 insight into the earliest steps in the induction of cancer. A
                 mutational hotspot might be created by preferential lesion
                 formation, decreased lesion repair, or increased misinsertion
                 past the lesion during DNA replication. The respective
                 contribution of these factors might be influenced by the DNA
                 sequence context of the hotspot. RESULTS: As a prelude to
                 addressing the contribution of all possible nearest-neighbor
                 contexts on the replication past O6-methylguanine (m6G) and
                 repair of m6G in vivo, we have devised a mutation frequency
                 (MF) detection strategy on the basis of the properties of type
                 IIs restriction enzymes. We also report a method for
                 constructing site-specific single-stranded viral DNA genomes
                 that should yield identical ligation efficiencies regardless
                 of the lesion or its surrounding sequence context. Using
                 repair-deficient Escherichia coli, we discovered that m6G in
                 three sequence contexts was nearly 100\% mutagenic in vivo,
                 showing that the DNA polymerase holoenzyme almost always
                 placed a thymine base opposite m6G during replication. In
                 partially repair-proficient cells, the Ada
                 O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repair protein was
                 twice as efficient on m6G when a guanine base rather than an
                 adenine base was 5' to the lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The system
                 allows the mutagenic potential of, theoretically, any DNA
                 lesion that exhibits point mutations, in any varied local
                 sequence context, to be rapidly determined. The assay

                 Although the recent structural studies on polymerases have
                 brought new insights on polymerase fidelity, the role of DNA
                 sequence and structure is less well understood. Here, the
                 analysis of the crystal structures of hotspots for polymerase
                 slippage including (CA)n and (A)n tracts in different
                 intermolecular contexts reveals that, in the B-form, these
                 sequences share common structural alterations which may
                 explain the high rate of replication errors. In particular, a
                 two-faced ``Janus-like'' structure with shifted base-pairs in
                 the major groove but an apparent normal geometry in the minor
                 groove constitutes a molecular decoy specifically suitable to
                 mislead the polymerases. A model of the rat polymerase beta
                 bound to this structure suggests that an altered conformation
                 of the nascent template-primer duplex can interfere with
                 correct nucleotide incorporation by affecting the geometry of
                 the active site and breaking the rules of base-pairing, while
                 at the same time escaping enzymatic mechanisms of error
                 discrimination which scan for the correct geometry of the
                 minor groove.In contrast, by showing that the A-form greatly
                 attenuates the sequence-dependent structural alterations in
                 hotspots, this study suggests that the A-conformation of the
                 nascent template-primer duplex at the vicinity of the
                 polymerase active site will contribute to fidelity. The A-form
                 may play the role of a structural buffer which preserves the
                 correct geometry of the active site for all sequences. The
                 detailed comparison of the conformation of the nascent
                 template-primer duplex in the available crystal structures of
                 DNA polymerase-DNA complexes shows that polymerase beta, the
                 least accurate enzyme, is unique in binding to a B-DNA duplex
                 even close to its active site. This model leads to several

                 have evolved. Perhaps most intriguing about the workings of
                 these repair systems is the actual damage recognition process.
                 What are the chemical characteristics which are common to
                 sites of nucleic acid damage that DNA repair proteins may
                 exploit in targeting sites? Importantly, thermodynamic and
                 kinetic principles, as much as structural factors, make damage
                 sites distinct from the native DNA bases, and indeed, in many
                 cases, these are the features which are believed to be
                 exploited by repair enzymes. Current proposals for damage
                 recognition may not fulfill all of the demands required of
                 enzymatic repair systems given the sheer size of many genomes,
                 and the efficiency with which the genome is screened for
                 damage. Here we discuss current models for how DNA damage

                 thermodynamic and kinetic instabilities associated with
                 aberrant sites. Additionally, we describe how small changes in

                 greater in the germ lines of males. This is usually explained
                 as resulting from the larger number of germ cell divisions
                 during spermatogenesis compared with oogenesis, with the
                 assumption made that mutations occur primarily during DNA
                 replication. However, the rate of cell division is not the
                 only difference between male and female germ lines, and
                 mechanisms are known that can give rise to mutations
                 independently of DNA replication. We investigate the
                 possibility that there are other causes of male-biased
                 mutation. First, we show that patterns of variation at
                 approximately 5,200 short tandem repeat (STR) loci indicate a
                 higher mutation rate in males. We estimate a ratio of
                 male-to-female mutation rates of approximately 1.9. This is
                 significantly greater than 1 and supports a greater rate of
                 mutation in males, affecting the evolution of these loci.
                 Second, we show that there are chromosome-specific patterns of
                 nucleotide and dinucleotide composition in mammals that have
                 been shaped by mutation at CpG dinucleotides. Comparable
                 patterns occur in birds. In mammals, male germ lines are more
                 methylated than female germ lines, and these patterns indicate
                 that differential methylation has played a role in male-biased
                 vertebrate evolution. However, estimates of male mutation bias
                 obtained from both classes of mutation are substantially lower
                 than estimates of cell division bias from anatomical data.

               selection at the DNA level in population samples has been
               ongoing for the past 13 years. The current state of the field is
               reviewed, and the available tests of selection are described.
               All tests use predictions from the theory of neutrally evolving
               sites as a null hypothesis. Departures from equilibrium-neutral
               expectations can indicate the presence of natural selection
               acting either at one or more of the sites under investigation or
               at a sufficiently tightly linked site. Complications can arise
               in the interpretation of departures from neutrality if
               populations are not at equilibrium for mutation and genetic
               drift or if populations are subdivided, both of which are likely

                 of Escherichia coli selected for resistance to trimethoprim
                 result from a TA to AT transversion at a single site within an
                 imperfect inverted repeat or quasipalindrome sequence. This
                 natural quasipalindrome within the coding region of thyA
                 contains an extraordinarily potent hotspot for mutation. Our
                 analysis provides evidence that these mutations are templated
                 by nearby sequences by replication within a hairpin structure.
                 Although quasipalindrome-associated mutations have been
                 observed in many organisms, including humans, the cellular
                 avoidance mechanisms for these unusual mutational events have
                 remained unexplored. We find that the mutational hotspot in
                 thyA is dramatically stimulated by inactivation of
                 exonucleases I and VII, which degrade single-strand DNA with a
                 common 3'-5' polarity. We propose that these exonucleases
                 abort the replicative misalignment events that initiate
                 hairpin-templated mutagenesis by degrading displaced nascent
                 DNA strands. Mismatch repair-defective strains also showed
                 increased mutability at the hotspot, consistent with the
                 notion that these mutations arise during chromosomal
                 lagging-strand replication and are often subsequently removed
                 by methyl-directed mismatch repair. The absence of the thyA
                 quasipalindrome sequence from other related bacterial genera
                 suggests that this sequence represents a ``selfish'' DNA
                 element whose existence itself is driven by this unusual
                 hairpin-templating mechanism.",

                 important problem in molecular biology, because these spectra
                 often reflect on important features of mutations and their
                 fixation. Such features include the interaction of DNA with
                 various mutagens, the function of repair/replication enzymes,
                 and properties of target proteins. It is known that mutability

                 mutations often concentrate at certain positions, called
                 ``hotspots,'' in a sequence. In this paper, we discuss in
                 detail two approaches for mutation spectra analysis: the

                 effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to
                 create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had
                 been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the
                 cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded
                 group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies
                 to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the
                 final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold
                 coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar
                 results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The
                 assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the
                 human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold
                 assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in
                 scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome
                 sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for
                 which there was strong corroborating evidence and an
                 additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes
                 with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although
                 gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are
                 dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of
                 apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
                 spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the
                 genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks,
                 ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant
                 throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary
                 history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate
                 expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with
                 tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the
                 hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons
                 between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data
                 provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide
                 polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes
                 differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was
                 marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the
                 genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in
                 proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have
                 functional consequences remains an open challenge.",

                 repair (NER) is a major pathway to counteract the mutagenic
                 effects of DNA damage. Two NER subpathways have been
                 identified, global genome repair (GGR) and
                 transcription-coupled repair (TCR). In contrast to somatic
                 cells, little is known regarding the expression of these
                 pathways in germ cells. To address this basic question, we
                 have studied NER in rat spermatogenic cells in crude cell

                 pathways is base excision repair (BER) which is initiated by
                 DNA glycosylases that excise damaged bases, followed by
                 incision of the generated abasic (AP) sites. We have studied

  abstract    = "There is increasing evidence that most human cancers contain
                 multiple mutations. By the time a tumor is clinically
                 detectable it may have accumulated tens of thousands of
                 mutations. In normal cells, mutations are rare events
                 occurring at a rate of 10(-10) mutations per nucleotide per
                 cell per generation. We have argued that the mutation rates
                 exhibited by normal human cells are insufficient to account
                 for the large number of mutations found in human cancers, and
                 therefore, that an early event in tumorigenesis is the
                 development of a mutator phenotype. In normal cells,
                 spontaneous and induced DNA damage is balanced by multiple
                 pathways for DNA repair, and most DNA damage is repaired
                 without error. However, in tumor cells this balance may be
                 shifted such that damage overwhelms the repair capacity,
                 resulting in the accumulation of multiple mutations. Our
                 hypothesis is that multiple random mutations occur during
                 carcinogenesis. The sequential mutations that are observed in
                 some human tumors result from selective events required for
                 tumor progression. We consider the possibility that endogenous
                 sources of DNA damage, in particular oxidative DNA damage, may
                 contribute to genomic instability and to a mutator phenotype
                 in some tumors. Endogenous and environmental sources of
                 reactive oxygen species (ROS) are abundant. In tumor cells,
                 antioxidant or DNA repair capacity may be insufficient to
                 compensate for the production of ROS, and these endogenous ROS
                 may be capable of damaging DNA and inducing mutations in
                 critical DNA stability genes. The possibility that oxidative
                 DNA damage could be a significant source of the genomic
                 instability characteristic of human cancers is exciting,
                 because it may be feasible to modulate the extent of oxidative
                 damage through antioxidant therapy. The use of antioxidants to
                 reduce the extent of molecular damage by ROS could delay the

                 mismatches that have escaped the proofreading function of

                 highlights its essential role in mutation avoidance. Recently,
                 three-dimensional structures of MutS, a key repair protein

                 length. Specific binding, followed by the next step of
                 tracking the DNA helix that locates hemi-methylated sites, is
                 regulated by the conformational state of the protein as a
                 function of ATP binding/hydrolysis. Here, we study how various
                 molecular determinants of a heteroduplex regulate mismatch
                 recognition by MutS, the critical first step of mismatch
                 repair. Using classical DNase I footprinting assays, we
                 demonstrate that the hierarchy of MutS binding to various
                 types of mismatches is identical whether the mismatches are
                 present singly or in multiples. Moreover, this unique

                 reduction in the affinity might be due to sequence context

                 asked whether this pool asymmetry affects the fidelity of DNA

                 cells. By monitoring reversion of either a TGA or TAA codon
                 within the lacZalpha gene, we found that replication in
                 ``biologically biased'' dNTPs, representing our estimate of

                 more accurate than when measured in reaction mixtures
                 containing the four dNTPs at equimolar concentrations.
                 However, sequence analysis of revertants revealed
                 significantly different patterns of mispairing events leading
                 to mutation. During replication at biased dNTP levels,
                 mutations at the site 5' to C in the template strand for the
                 TGA triplet were less frequent than seen in equimolar reaction
                 mixtures, suggesting that extension from mismatches at this

                 Mismatches opposite template C, which might have been favored
                 by the low physiological concentrations of dGTP, were not
                 favored in our in vitro system, although one particular
                 substitution at this site, TGA-->TTA, was strongly favored at
                 low [dGTP]. An excess of one dNTP was found in our system to
                 be more mutagenic than a corresponding deficiency. We also
                 estimated dNTP concentrations in non-transformed human
                 fibroblasts and found that in vitro replication at these
                 levels caused significantly fewer mutations than we observed

                 extends at higher orders to oligonucleotide composition, at
                 least in some organisms or taxa. However, the scientific
                 literature falls short of providing a comprehensive study of
                 reverse-complement symmetry at multiple orders and across the
                 kingdom of life. It also lacks a characterization of this
                 symmetry and a convincing explanation or clarification of its
                 origin. RESULTS: We develop methods to measure and
                 characterize symmetry at multiple orders, and analyze a wide
                 set of genomes, encompassing single- and double-stranded RNA
                 and DNA viruses, bacteria, archae, mitochondria, and
                 eukaryota. We quantify symmetry at orders 1 to 9 for
                 contiguous sequences and pools of coding and non-coding
                 upstream regions, compare the observed symmetry levels to
                 those predicted by simple statistical models, and factor out
                 the effect of lower-order distributions. We establish the
                 universality and variability range of first-order strand
                 symmetry, as well as of its higher-order extensions, and
                 demonstrate the existence of genuine high-order symmetric
                 constraints. We show that ubiquitous reverse-complement
                 symmetry does not result from a single cause, such as point
                 mutation or recombination, but rather emerges from the

                 that specifically recognizes and removes uracil from double-
                 or single-stranded DNA. The efficiency of the enzyme depends
                 on the DNA sequence surrounding the uracil. Crystal structures
                 of UDG in complex with DNA reveal that the DNA is severely
                 bent and distorted in the region of the uracil. This suggests
                 that the sequence-dependent efficiency of the enzyme may be
                 related to the energetic cost of DNA distortion in the process
                 of specific damage recognition. To test this hypothesis,
                 molecular dynamics simulations were performed on two sequences
                 representing extreme cases of UDG efficiency, AUA/TAT (high
                 efficiency) and GUG/CAC (low efficiency). Analysis of the
                 simulations shows that the effective bending force constants
                 are lower for the AUA/TAT sequence, indicating that this
                 sequence is more flexible than the GUG/CAC sequence.
                 Fluorescence lifetimes of the adenine analogue 2-aminopurine
                 (2AP), replacing adenine opposite the uracil, are shorter in

                 base-base interaction and greater local flexibility than in
                 the GUG/CAC sequence. Furthermore, the K(M) of Escherichia
                 coli UDG for the AUA/TAT sequence is 10-fold smaller than that
                 for the GUG/CAC sequence, while the k(cat) is only 2-fold
                 smaller. This indicates that differences in UDG efficiency
                 largely arise from differences in binding and not catalysis.

                 that the consequent variation in gene expression is twofold or

                 factor-DNA interactions are highly polymorphic, and regulatory
                 interactions have been gained and lost within human

                 human genetic conditions (e.g., achondroplasia) increase in

                 the result of an increasing frequency of mutant sperm as a man
                 grows older, no direct molecular measurement of the germ-line
                 mutation frequency has been made to confirm this hypothesis.
                 Using sperm DNA from donors of different ages, we determined

                 population-based sequencing study of 202 genes in >14,000
                 individuals. We observed considerable variability in the
                 per-gene mutation rate, which was correlated with local GC
                 content, but not recombination rate. Using >20,000 variants

                 and errors in OMIM records, mapping a specific OMIM mutation
                 to its corresponding protein sequence is not trivial.
                 Combining computer programs and extensive manual curation of
                 OMIM full-text descriptions and original literature, we mapped

                 invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a

                 organisms, and occupy about 3\% of the human genome. Although
                 it is becoming clear that such repeats are important in
                 genomic organization and function and may be associated with
                 disease conditions, their systematic analysis has not been
                 reported. This is the first report examining the distribution
                 and density of simple sequence repeats (1-6 base-pairs (bp))
                 in the entire human genome. RESULTS: The densities of SSRs
                 across the human chromosomes were found to be relatively
                 uniform. However, the overall density of SSR was found to be
                 high in chromosome 19. Triplets and hexamers were more
                 predominant in exonic regions compared to intronic and
                 intergenic regions, except for chromosome Y. Comparison of
                 densities of various SSRs revealed that whereas trimers and
                 pentamers showed a similar pattern (500-1,000 bp/Mb) across
                 the chromosomes, di- tetra- and hexa-nucleotide repeats showed
                 patterns of higher (2,000-3,000 bp/Mb) density. Repeats of the
                 same nucleotide were found to be higher than other repeat
                 types. Repeats of A, AT, AC, AAT, AAC, AAG, AGC, AAAC, AAAT,
                 AAAG, AAGG, AGAT predominate, whereas repeats of C, CG, ACT,
                 ACG, AACC, AACG, AACT, AAGC, AAGT, ACCC, ACCG, ACCT, CCCG and
                 CCGG are rare. CONCLUSIONS: The overall SSR density was
                 comparable in all chromosomes. The density of different
                 repeats, however, showed significant variation. Tri- and
                 hexa-nucleotide repeats are more abundant in exons, whereas

                 mutability (propensity to mutate) of a base in a DNA secondary
                 structure depends both on the stability of the structure and
                 on the extent to which the base is unpaired. Zuker's DNA
                 folding computer program reveals the most probable stem-loop
                 structures (SLSs) and negative energies of folding (-DeltaG)
                 for any given nucleotide sequence. We developed an interfacing
                 program that calculates (i) the percentage of folds in which
                 each base is unpaired during transcription; and (ii) the
                 mutability index (MI) for each base, expressed as an absolute
                 value and defined as -follows: MI = (\% total folds in which
                 the base is unpaired) x (highest -DeltaG of all folds in which
                 it is unpaired). Thus, MIs predict the relative mutation or
                 reversion frequencies of unpaired bases in SLSs. MIs for 16
                 mutable bases in auxotrophs, selected during starvation in
                 derepressed genes, are compared with 70 background mutations
                 in lacI and ebgR that were not derepressed during mutant
                 selection. All the results are consistent with the location of
                 known mutable bases in SLSs. Specific conclusions are: (i) Of
                 16 mutable bases in transcribing genes, 87\% have higher MIs
                 than the average base of the sequence analysed, compared with
                 50\% for the 70 background mutations. (ii) In 15 of the
                 mutable bases of transcribing genes, the correlation between
                 MIs and relative mutation frequencies determined
                 experimentally is good. There is no correlation for 35 mutable
                 bases in the lacI gene. (iii) In derepressed auxotrophs, 100\%
                 of the codons containing the mutable bases are within one
                 codon's length of a stem, compared with 53\% for the
                 background mutable bases in lacI. (iv) The data suggest that
                 environmental stressors may cause as well as select mutations

                 sequence with a fluorescent guanine analogue,
                 6-methylisoxanthopterin (6MI). Our results indicate that each
                 sequence opens spontaneously towards the major groove in the

                 proportion of structures in the open state than the CGC/GUG
                 sequence. Incorporation of 6MI yields wobble base-pairs that
                 open more readily than their guanine counterparts. In order of
                 increasing open population, the sequences are ordered as
                 CGC<TGT<CMC<TMT, where M represents 6MI. Both members of the
                 base-pair open towards the major groove in a symmetrically
                 coupled motion. Opening results in breakage of the
                 H3(U)-O6(G/6MI) hydrogen bond, and distortion of the
                 H1(G/6MI)-O2(U) hydrogen bond. Structural consequences of the
                 opening include the formation of the H21(G/6MI)-O2(U) hydrogen
                 bond and a change in local solvation in the grooves and
                 particularly near N3-H3 of uracil. Additionally, DNA
                 flexibility is reduced in the open state for bending towards

                 intrinsic properties of the mutation process, such as sequence
                 specificity, that manifests itself at the level of interaction
                 between mutagens, DNA, and the action of the repair and

                 structural and functional features of the respective DNA
                 sequences. When mutations in a gene are identified using a
                 particular experimental system, resulting hotspots could
                 reflect the properties of the gene product and the mutant
                 selection scheme. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence context
                 of hotspots can provide information on the molecular
                 mechanisms of mutagenesis. However, the determinants of
                 mutation frequency and specificity are complex, and there are
                 many analytical methods for their study. Here we review
                 computational approaches for analyzing mutation spectra
                 (distribution of mutations along the target genes) that
                 include many mutable (detectable) positions. The following
                 methods are reviewed: derivation of a consensus sequence,
                 application of regression approaches to correlate nucleotide
                 sequence features with mutation frequency, mutation hotspot
                 prediction, analysis of oligonucleotide composition of regions
                 containing mutations, pairwise comparison of mutation spectra,
                 analysis of multiple spectra, and analysis of ``context-free''
                 characteristics. The advantages and pitfalls of these methods
                 are discussed and illustrated by examples from the literature.
                 The most reliable analyses were obtained when several methods
                 were combined and information from theoretical analysis and
                 experimental observations was considered simultaneously.
                 Simple, robust approaches should be used with small samples of
                 mutations, whereas combinations of simple and complex
                 approaches may be required for large samples. We discuss

                 and replication errors. DNA damage may cause mutations

                 stress from ionising radiation and oxidative metabolism causes
                 base damage, as well as strand breaks in DNA. Base damage is
                 mostly indirect and caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
                 generated, e.g. O2(.-) (superoxide radical), OH. (hydroxyl
                 radical) and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). ROS also oxidise RNA,
                 lipids, proteins and nucleotides. The first line of defence
                 against ROS is enzymatic inactivation of superoxide by
                 superoxide dismutase and inactivation of the less toxic
                 hydrogen peroxide by catalase. As a second line of defence,
                 incorporation of damaged bases into DNA is prevented by
                 enzymes that hydrolyse oxidised dNTPs (e.g. 8-oxodGTP) to the
                 corresponding dNMP. The third line of defence is repair of
                 oxidative damage in DNA by an intricate network of DNA repair
                 mechanisms. Base excision repair (BER), transcription-coupled
                 repair (TCR), global genome repair (GGR), mismatch repair
                 (MMR), translesion synthesis (TLS), homologous recombination
                 (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) all contribute to
                 repair of oxidative DNA damage. These mechanisms are also
                 integrated with other cellular processes such as cell cycle
                 regulation, transcription and replication and even use some
                 common proteins. BER is the major pathway for repair of
                 oxidative base damage, with TCR and MMR being important backup
                 pathways for repair of transcribed strands and newly
                 replicated strands, respectively. In recent years, several new
                 DNA glycosylases that initiate BER of oxidative damage have
                 been identified. These have specificities overlapping with
                 previously known DNA glycosylases and serve as backups, and
                 may have distinct roles as well. Thus, there is both inter-
                 and intra-pathway complementation in repair of oxidative base
                 damage, explaining the limited effects of absence of single

                 mismatches and insertion/deletion loops by the family of MutS
                 proteins. Subsequently, ATP induces a unique conformational
                 change in the MutS-mismatch complex but not in the
                 MutS-homoduplex complex that sets off the cascade of events
                 that leads to repair. To gain insight into the mechanism by
                 which MutS discriminates between mismatch and homoduplex DNA,
                 we have examined the conformations of specific and nonspecific
                 MutS-DNA complexes by using atomic force microscopy.
                 Interestingly, MutS-DNA complexes exhibit a single population
                 of conformations, in which the DNA is bent at homoduplex
                 sites, but two populations of conformations, bent and unbent,
                 at mismatch sites. These results suggest that the specific

                 Combining our results with existing biochemical and
                 crystallographic data leads us to propose that MutS: (i) binds
                 to DNA nonspecifically and bends it in search of a mismatch;
                 (ii) on specific recognition of a mismatch, undergoes a
                 conformational change to an initial recognition complex in
                 which the DNA is kinked, with interactions similar to those in

                 affect the survival of the descendants, intrinsic variations

                 epidemiological outcome has never been demonstrated. In this
                 study, we surveyed odds ratios detected for 46 SNPs in 39
                 different cancer-related genes from 166 molecular
                 epidemiological studies. The conservation levels of amino acid
                 that these SNPs affected were calculated as a tolerance index
                 by comparing sequences from different species. Our results
                 provide evidence of a significant relationship between the
                 detected odds ratios associated with cancer risk and the
                 conservation levels of the SNP-affected amino acids (P =
                 0.002; R(2) = 0.06). Tolerance indices were further calculated
                 for 355 nonsynonymous SNPs identified in 90 human DNA repair
                 genes, of which 103 caused amino acid changes in very
                 conserved positions. Our findings support the concept that
                 SNPs altering the conserved amino acids are more likely to be
                 associated with cancer susceptibility. Using such a molecular
                 evolutionary approach may hold great promise for prioritizing
                 SNPs to be genotyped in future molecular epidemiological

                 genetic and biochemical assays were used to analyse the DNA
                 target specificities of cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC
                 family. The results reveal the critical importance of
                 nucleotides immediately 5' of the targeted C for the
                 specificity of all three enzymes studied (AID, APOBEC1 and
                 APOBEC3G). At position -1, APOBEC1 showed a marked preference
                 for dT, AID for dA/dG and APOBEC3G a strong preference for dC.
                 Furthermore, AID and APOBEC3G showed distinct dependence on
                 the nucleotide at position -2 with dA/dT being favoured by AID
                 and dC by APOBEC3G. Most if not all activity of the
                 recombinant deaminases on free dC could be attributed to
                 low-level contamination by host enzymes. The target preference
                 of APOBEC3G supports it being a major but possibly not sole
                 contributor to HIV hypermutation without making it a dominant
                 contribution to general HIV sequence variation. The
                 specificity of AID as deduced from the genetic assay (which
                 relies on inactivation of sacB of Bacillus subtilis) agrees
                 well with that deduced by Pham et al. using an in vitro assay
                 although we postulate that major intrinsic mutational hotspots
                 in immunoglobulin V genes in vivo might reflect favoured sites
                 of AID action being generated by proximal DNA targets located
                 on opposite DNA strands. The target specificity of AID also
                 accords with the spectrum of mutations observed in B
                 lymphoma-associated oncogenes. The possibility of deaminase
                 involvement in non-lymphoid human tumours is hinted at by
                 tissue-specific differences in the spectra of dC transitions
                 in tumour-suppressor genes. Thus, the patterns of
                 hypermutation in antibodies and retroviruses owe much to the
                 intrinsic sequence preferences of the AID/APOBEC family of DNA
                 deaminases: analogous biases might also contribute to the

                 Failure by NER or MMR to recognize DNA damage threatens the
                 genetic integrity of the organism and may play a role in
                 carcinogenesis. Both NER and MMR recognize and repair a wide
                 variety of structurally dissimilar lesions against the
                 background of normal DNA. Previous studies have suggested that
                 detection of thermodynamic destabilization of DNA caused by
                 covalent damage and base mismatches is a potential mechanism
                 by which repair pathways with broad specificity such as NER
                 and MMR recognize their substrates. However, both NER and MMR
                 respectively, repair a wide variety of stabilizing and
                 destabilizing covalent DNA lesions and base pair mismatches. A
                 common feature of lesions that are both thermodynamically
                 stabilizing and destabilizing is the alteration of the local

                 experimental evidence for altered dynamics from NMR and
                 thermodynamic studies on normal and damaged DNA molecules with
                 respect to recognition by NER and MMR. Based on these data, we
                 propose a model for initial detection of lesions by both NER
                 and MMR that occurs through an indirect readout mechanism of

                 Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the optimum association
                 between PIB motif density and mutations occurs when a 7bp
                 radius is used for the window size. Randomly simulated
                 mutations showed no association with PIB motif density. When
                 the method was applied to human TP53 mutation data, we saw
                 similar results, but no strand bias. As PIB motif density
                 rises, linear trends are observed for increasing odds of
                 mutation. Sensitivity analysis revealed associations between
                 PIB motifs and GC --> AT transitions and GC --> TA
                 transversions-the most commonly observed types of mutations
                 arising from oxidative DNA damage. DNA-metal binding motifs

                 many where conformational sensitivity to redox state is

                 DNA-iron-binding may affect lesions and subsequent mutations

                 related genes and drugs. We then used supervised machine

                 damage guanine residues and lead to the production of
                 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG), the major mutagenic oxidative lesion in
                 the genome. Oxidative damage is implicated in ageing and
                 cancer, and its prevalence presents a constant challenge to
                 DNA polymerases that ensure accurate transmission of genomic
                 information. When these polymerases encounter 8oxoG, they
                 frequently catalyse misincorporation of adenine in preference
                 to accurate incorporation of cytosine. This results in the
                 propagation of G to T transversions, which are commonly
                 observed somatic mutations associated with human cancers.
                 Here, we present sequential snapshots of a high-fidelity DNA

                 mechanisms that normally proofread DNA, such that the

                 mismatches that evade polymerase error-detection mechanisms,

                 that lead to a single amino acid change in an encoded protein.
                 An increasing number of complex diseases have also been
                 associated with amino acid-changing single-nucleotide
                 polymorphisms (coding SNPs, cSNPs), suggesting potential
                 similarities between Mendelian and complex diseases at the
                 molecular level. Here, we use two different evolutionary
                 analyses to compare Mendelian and complex disease-associated
                 cSNPs. In the first, we estimate the likelihood that a
                 specific amino acid substitution in a protein will affect the
                 protein's function, by using amino acid substitution scores
                 derived from an alignment of related protein sequences and
                 statistics from hidden Markov models. In the second, we use
                 standard Ka/Ks ratios to make comparisons at the gene, rather
                 than the individual amino acid, level. We find that Mendelian
                 disease cSNPs have a very strong tendency to occur at highly
                 conserved amino acid positions in proteins, suggesting that
                 they generally have a severe impact on the function of the
                 protein. Perhaps surprisingly, the distribution of amino acid
                 substitution scores for complex disease cSNPs is dramatically
                 different from the distribution for Mendelian disease cSNPs,
                 and is indistinguishable from the distribution for ``normal''
                 human variation. Further, the distributions of Ka/Ks ratios
                 for human and mouse orthologs indicate greater positive
                 selection (or less negative selection) pressure on complex
                 disease-associated genes, on average. These findings suggest
                 that caution should be exercised when using Mendelian disease
                 as a model for complex disease, at least with respect to

                 recent evidence suggests that synonymous mutations may not be
                 selectively neutral. This position has proven contentious, not
                 least because of the absence of a viable mechanism. Here we
                 test whether synonymous mutations might be under selection
                 owing to their effects on the thermodynamic stability of mRNA,
                 mediated by changes in secondary structure.RESULTS:We provide
                 numerous lines of evidence that are all consistent with the
                 above hypothesis. Most notably, by simulating evolution and
                 reallocating the substitutions observed in the mouse lineage,
                 we show that the location of synonymous mutations is
                 non-random with respect to stability. Importantly, the
                 preference for cytosine at 4-fold degenerate sites, diagnostic
                 of selection, can be explained by its effect on mRNA
                 stability. Likewise, by interchanging synonymous codons, we
                 find naturally occurring mRNAs to be more stable than simulant
                 transcripts. Housekeeping genes, whose proteins are under
                 strong purifying selection, are also under the greatest
                 pressure to maintain stability.CONCLUSION:Taken together, our
                 results provide evidence that, in mammals, synonymous sites do
                 not evolve neutrally, at least in part owing to selection on
                 mRNA stability. This has implications for the application of
                 synonymous divergence in estimating the mutation rate.",

                 sequences such that mutations often concentrate at certain
                 positions called hotspots. Mutation hotspots in DNA reflect
                 intrinsic properties of the mutation process, such as sequence
                 specificity, that manifests itself at the level of interaction
                 between mutagens, DNA, and the action of the repair and
                 replication machineries. The nucleotide sequence context of
                 mutational hotspots is a fingerprint of interactions between
                 DNA and repair/replication/modification enzymes, and the
                 analysis of hotspot context provides evidence of such
                 interactions. The hotspots might also reflect structural and
                 functional features of the respective DNA sequences and
                 provide information about natural selection. We discuss
                 analysis of 8-oxoguanine-induced mutations in pro- and

                 fraction of spontaneous A x T-->C x T mutations is caused by

                 UVA components of solar radiation are implicated individually
                 or synergistically. Interestingly, further mechanistic
                 insights into the UV-induced formation of DNA photoproducts
                 were gained from the application of new accurate and sensitive
                 chromatographic and enzymic assays aimed at measuring base
                 damage. Thus, each of the twelve possible dimeric
                 photoproducts that are produced at the four main bipyrimidine
                 sites can now be singled out as dinucleoside monophosphates
                 that are enzymatically released from UV-irradiated DNA. This
                 was achieved using a recently developed high-performance
                 liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay
                 (HPLC-MS/MS) assay after DNA extraction and appropriate
                 enzymic digestion. Interestingly, a similar photoproduct
                 distribution pattern is observed in both isolated and cellular
                 DNA upon exposure to low doses of either UVC or UVB radiation.
                 This applies more specifically to the DNA of rodent and human
                 cells, the cis-syn cyclobutadithymine being predominant over
                 the two other main photolesions, namely thymine-cytosine
                 pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone adduct and the related cyclobutyl

                 dimers at TT and to a lower extent at TC sites as a likely
                 result of energy transfer mechanism involving still unknown
                 photoexcited chromophore(s). Oxidative damage to DNA is also
                 induced although less efficiently by UVA-mediated

                 functional yeast and mammalian cell assays to assess their
                 effect on p53 transactivation. Among approximately 2 million
                 human SNPs, we identified >200 that seem to disrupt functional
                 p53 REs. Eight of these SNPs were evaluated in functional
                 assays to determine both the activity of the putative RE and
                 the impact of the candidate SNPs on transactivation. All eight
                 candidate REs were functional, and in every case the SNP pair
                 exhibited differential transactivation capacities.
                 Additionally, six of the eight genes adjacent to these SNPs
                 are induced by genotoxic stress or are activated directly by
                 transfection with p53 cDNA. Thus, this strategy efficiently
                 identifies SNPs that may differentially affect gene expression
                 responses in the p53 regulatory pathway.",

  abstract    = "Levels of diversity vary across the human genome. This
                 variation is caused by two forces: differences in mutation
                 rates and the differential impact of natural selection.
                 Pertinent to the question of the relative importance of these
                 two forces is the observation that both diversity within
                 species and interspecies divergence increase with
                 recombination rates. This suggests that mutation and
                 recombination are either directly coupled or linked through
                 some third factor. Here, we test these possibilities using the
                 recently generated sequence of the chimpanzee genome and new
                 estimates of human diversity. We find that measures of GC and
                 CpG content, simple-repeat structures, as well as the distance
                 from the centromeres and the telomeres predict diversity as
                 well as divergence. After controlling for these factors,
                 large-scale recombination rates measured from pedigrees are
                 still significant predictors of human diversity and
                 human-chimpanzee divergence. Furthermore, the correlation
                 between human diversity and recombination remains significant
                 even after controlling for human-chimpanzee divergence. Two
                 plausible and non-mutually exclusive explanations are, first,
                 that natural selection has shaped the patterns of diversity
                 seen in humans and, second, that recombination rates across
                 the genome have changed since humans and chimpanzees shared a
                 common ancestor, so that current recombination rates are a
                 better predictor of diversity than of divergence. Because
                 there are indications that recombination rates may have
                 changed rapidly during human evolution, we favor the latter
                 explanation.",

                 microdeletions and microinsertions causing inherited disease
                 (both defined as involving < or = 20 bp of DNA) account for
                 8,399 (17\%) and 3,345 (7\%) logged mutations, in 940 and 668
                 genes, respectively. A positive correlation was noted between
                 the microdeletion and microinsertion frequencies for 564 genes
                 for which both microdeletions and microinsertions are reported
                 in HGMD, consistent with the view that the propensity of a
                 given gene/sequence to undergo microdeletion is related to its
                 propensity to undergo microinsertion. While microdeletions and
                 microinsertions of 1 bp constitute respectively 48\% and 66\%
                 of the corresponding totals, the relative frequency of the
                 remaining lesions correlates negatively with the length of the
                 DNA sequence deleted or inserted. Many of the microdeletions
                 and microinsertions of more than 1 bp are potentially
                 explicable in terms of slippage mutagenesis, involving the
                 addition or removal of one copy of a mono-, di-, or
                 trinucleotide tandem repeat. The frequency of in-frame 3-bp
                 and 6-bp microinsertions and microdeletions was, however,
                 found to be significantly lower than that of mutations of
                 other lengths, suggesting that some of these in-frame lesions
                 may not have come to clinical attention. Various sequence
                 motifs were found to be over-represented in the vicinity of
                 both microinsertions and microdeletions, including the
                 heptanucleotide CCCCCTG that shares homology with the
                 complement of the 8-bp human minisatellite conserved
                 sequence/chi-like element (GCWGGWGG). The previously reported
                 indel hotspot GTAAGT and its complement ACTTAC were also found
                 to be overrepresented in the vicinity of both microinsertions
                 and microdeletions, thereby providing a first example of a
                 mutational hotspot that is common to different types of gene
                 lesion. Other motifs overrepresented in the vicinity of
                 microdeletions and microinsertions included DNA polymerase
                 pause sites and topoisomerase cleavage sites. Several novel
                 microdeletion/microinsertion hotspots were noted and some of
                 these exhibited sufficient similarity to one another to
                 justify terming them ``super-hotspot'' motifs. Analysis of
                 sequence complexity also demonstrated that a combination of
                 slipped mispairing mediated by direct repeats, and secondary
                 structure formation promoted by symmetric elements, can
                 account for the majority of microdeletions and
                 microinsertions. Thus, microinsertions and microdeletions
                 exhibit strong similarities in terms of the characteristics of
                 their flanking DNA sequences, implying that they are generated

                 of DNA and molecular biology by revealing the intriguing
                 systems of DNA repair essential to life. In fact,
                 modifications of the cut-and-patch principles identified by
                 Phil Hanawalt and colleagues underlie many of the common

                 outlined in this review. The emergence of these common themes
                 and a unified understanding have been greatly aided from the
                 direct visualizations of repair proteins and their
                 interactions with damaged DNA by structural biology. These
                 visualizations of DNA repair structures have complemented the
                 increasing wealth of biochemical and genetic information on
                 DNA base damage responses by revealing general themes for the
                 recognition of damaged bases, such as sequence-independent DNA
                 recognition motifs, minor groove reading heads for initial
                 damage recognition, and nucleotide flipping from the major
                 groove into active-site pockets for high specificity of base
                 damage recognition and removal. We know that repair
                 intermediates are as harmful as the initial damage itself, and
                 that these intermediates are protected from one repair step to
                 the next by the enzymes involved, such that pathway-specific
                 handoffs must be efficiently coordinated. Here we focus on the
                 structural biology of the repair enzymes and proteins that
                 recognize specific base lesions and either initiate the base
                 excision repair pathway or directly repair the damage in one
                 step. This understanding of the molecular basis for DNA base

                 complex traits is highly dependent on reliable assays and

                 with ancestry from Northern and Western Europe using the
                 publicly available phase I data of the International HapMap
                 project. The genes are located in regions of the human genome
                 with elevated functional annotation and disease interest
                 including the ENCODE regions spanning 1\% of the genome,
                 Chromosome 21 and Chromosome 20q12-13.2. We apply three
                 different methods of multiple test correction, including
                 Bonferroni, false discovery rate, and permutations. For the
                 374 expressed genes, we find many regions with statistically
                 significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms
                 (SNPs) with expression variation in lymphoblastoid cell lines

                 chromatin structures are indispensable features of repair
                 processes. During the last decade numerous chromatin proteins
                 have been identified that preferentially bind to different

                 ESEs do not function outside of exons, SNPs that disrupt ESE
                 motifs were expected to be more common in nonexonic portions
                 of the genome. Our results supported this expectation: ESEs
                 were least prevalent within synonymous SNPs and most common in
                 nongenic SNPs. There were approximately 11\% fewer ESEs within
                 synonymous biallelic SNPs than expected under no selective

  abstract    = "Silent sites in mammals have classically been assumed to be
                 free from selective pressures. Consequently, the synonymous
                 substitution rate (Ks) is often used as a proxy for the
                 mutation rate. Although accumulating evidence demonstrates
                 that the assumption is not valid, the mechanism by which
                 selection acts remain unclear. Recent work has revealed that
                 the presence of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in coding
                 sequence might influence synonymous evolution. ESEs are
                 predominantly located near intron-exon junctions, which may
                 explain the reduced single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
                 density in these regions. Here we show that synonymous sites
                 in putative ESEs evolve more slowly than the remaining exonic
                 sequence. Differential mutabilities of ESEs do not appear to
                 explain this difference. We observe that substitution
                 frequency at fourfold synonymous sites decreases as one
                 approaches the ends of exons, consistent with the existing SNP
                 data. This gradient is at least in part explained by ESEs
                 being more abundant near junctions. Between-gene variation in
                 Ks is hence partly explained by the proportion of the gene
                 that acts as an ESE. Given the relative abundance of ESEs and
                 the reduced rates of synonymous divergence within them, we
                 estimate that constraints on synonymous evolution within ESEs
                 causes the true mutation rate to be underestimated by not more
                 than approximately 8\%. We also find that Ks outside of ESEs
                 is much lower in alternatively spliced exons than in
                 constitutive exons, implying that other causes of selection on
                 synonymous mutations exist. Additionally, selection on ESEs
                 appears to affect nonsynonymous sites and may explain why
                 amino acid usage near intron-exon junctions is nonrandom.",

                 variants is difficult. Approximately 3\% of noncoding sequence
                 is conserved among distantly related mammals, suggesting that
                 these evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions (CNCs) are
                 selectively constrained and contain functional variation.
                 However, CNCs could also merely represent regions with lower
                 local mutation rates. Here we address this issue and show that
                 CNCs are selectively constrained in humans by analyzing HapMap
                 genotype data. Specifically, new (derived) alleles of SNPs
                 within CNCs are rarer than new alleles in nonconserved regions
                 (P = 3 x 10(-18)), indicating that evolutionary pressure has

                 DNA damage, is considered to be a natural cause of genomic
                 diversity in organisms because of its mutagenic potential. The
                 steady-state level of 8-oxoG in the nuclear genome of a human
                 cell has been estimated to be several residues per 10(6)

                 3' RR variants; 121 3' RR variants in 94 human genes were

                 sequence (USS) between the translational termination codon and

                 core polyadenylation signal sequence (DCPAS) and 7 in the

                 UCPAS mutations and the rather unusual cases of the DMPK,
                 SCA8, FCMD and GLA mutations exert a significant effect on the

                 systematic analysis of disease-associated variants in the 3'
                 RRs of human protein-coding genes. We have previously analysed
                 the variants that have occurred in two specific domains/motifs
                 of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) as well as in the 3'
                 flanking region. Here we have focused upon 83 known variants
                 within the upstream sequence (USS; between the translational
                 termination codon and the upstream core polyadenylation signal
                 sequence) of the 3' UTR. To place these variants in their
                 proper context, we first performed a comprehensive survey of
                 known cis-regulatory elements within the USS and the
                 mechanisms by which they effect post-transcriptional gene
                 regulation. Although this survey supports the view that RNA
                 regulatory elements function within the context of specific
                 secondary structures, there are no general rules governing how
                 secondary structure might exert its influence. We have
                 therefore addressed this question by systematically evaluating
                 both functional and non-functional (based upon in vitro
                 reporter gene and/or electrophoretic mobility shift assay

                 cis-regulatory motifs within the context of predicted RNA
                 secondary structures. This has allowed us not only to
                 establish a reliable and objective means to perform secondary
                 structure prediction but also to identify consistent patterns
                 of secondary structural change that could potentiate the
                 discrimination of functional USS variants from their
                 non-functional counterparts. The resulting rules were then
                 used to infer potential functionality in the case of some of
                 the remaining functionally uncharacterized USS variants, from
                 their predicted secondary structures. This not only led us to
                 identify further patterns of secondary structural change but

                 process based on the local density of known sites in sequence
                 space. Applied to the problem of RNA splicing regulation, NI

                 (ESE) and silencer (ESS) hexanucleotides from known human ESEs

                 and in identifying human disease genes.RESULTS:Using a wide
                 range of functional genomic data from the yeast Saccharomyces
                 cerevisiae, we show that the best predictor of a protein's
                 knockout phenotype is the knockout phenotype of other proteins

  abstract    = "Mutation has traditionally been considered a random process,
                 but this paradigm is challenged by recent evidence of
                 divergence rate heterogeneity in different genomic regions.
                 One facet of mutation rate variation is the propensity for
                 genetic change to correlate with the number of germ cell
                 divisions, reflecting the replication-dependent origin of many
                 mutations. Haldane was the first to connect this association
                 of replication and mutation to the difference in the number of
                 cell divisions in oogenesis (low) and spermatogenesis (usually
                 high), and the resulting sex difference in the rate of
                 mutation. The concept of male-biased mutation has been
                 thoroughly analysed in recent years using an evolutionary
                 approach, in which sequence divergence of autosomes and/or sex
                 chromosomes are compared to allow inference about the relative
                 contribution of mothers and fathers in the accumulation of
                 mutations. For instance, assuming that a neutral sequence is
                 analysed, that rate heterogeneity owing to other factors is
                 cancelled out by the investigation of many loci and that the
                 effect of ancestral polymorphism is properly taken into
                 account, the male-to-female mutation rate ratio, alpham, can
                 be solved from the observed difference in rate of X and Y
                 chromosome divergence. The male mutation bias is positively
                 correlated with the relative excess of cell divisions in the
                 male compared to the female germ line, as evidenced by a
                 generation time effect: in mammals, alpham is estimated at
                 approximately 4-6 in primates, approximately 3 in carnivores
                 and approximately 2 in small rodents. Another life-history
                 correlate is sexual selection: when there is intense sperm
                 competition among males, increased sperm production will be
                 associated with a larger number of mitotic cell divisions in
                 spermatogenesis and hence an increase in alpham. Male-biased
                 mutation has implications for important aspects of
                 evolutionary biology such as mate choice in relation to
                 mutation load, sexual selection and the maintenance of genetic
                 diversity despite strong directional selection, the tendency
                 for a disproportionate large role of the X (Z) chromosome in
                 post-zygotic isolation, and the evolution of sex.",

                 enhanced mismatch incorporation at 55 degrees C compared with
                 37 degrees C. The molecular dynamics simulations suggest that
                 mismatched nucleotide insertion opposite (+)-ta-[BP]G is
                 increased at 55 degrees C compared with 37 degrees C because
                 the higher temperature shifts the preference of the damaged
                 base from the anti to the syn conformation, with the
                 carcinogen on the more open major groove side. The mismatched
                 dNTP structures are less distorted when the damaged base is
                 syn than when it is anti, at the higher temperature. However,
                 with the normal partner dCTP, the anti conformation with close
                 to Watson-Crick alignment remains more favorable. The

                 The ability to distinguish those missense changes that
                 contribute to cancer progression from those that do not is a
                 difficult problem usually only accomplished through functional
                 in vivo analyses. Using two computational algorithms, Sorting
                 Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and the Pfam-based
                 LogR.E-value method, we have identified features that
                 distinguish cancer-associated missense mutations from other
                 classes of missense change. Our data reveal that cancer
                 mutants behave similarly to Mendelian disease mutations, but
                 are clearly distinct from either complex disease mutations or
                 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We show that both
                 activating and inactivating oncogenic mutations are predicted
                 to be deleterious, although activating changes are likely to
                 increase protein activity. Using the Gene Ontology and data
                 from the SIFT and LogR.E-value metrics, a classifier was built
                 that predicts cancer-associated missense mutations with a very
                 low false-positive rate. The classifier does remarkably well
                 in a number of different experiments designed to distinguish
                 polymorphisms from true cancer-associated mutations. We also
                 show that recurrently observed mutations are much more likely
                 to be predicted to be cancer-associated than rare mutations,
                 suggesting that our classifier will be useful in
                 distinguishing causal from passenger mutations. In addition,
                 from an expressed sequence tag-based screen, we identified a
                 previously unknown germ line change (P1104A) in tumor tissues

                 addition to gross karyotypic rearrangements such as the fusion
                 that formed human chromosome 2 and the human-specific
                 pericentric inversions of chromosomes 1 and 18, there is
                 considerable submicroscopic structural variation involving
                 deletions, duplications, and inversions. Lineage-specific
                 segmental duplications, detected by array comparative genomic
                 hybridization and direct sequence comparison, have made a very
                 significant contribution to this structural divergence, which
                 is at least three-fold greater than that due to nucleotide
                 substitutions. Since structural genomic changes may have given
                 rise to irreversible functional differences between the
                 diverging species, their detailed analysis could help to
                 identify the biological processes that have accompanied
                 speciation. To this end, interspecies comparisons have
                 revealed numerous human-specific gains and losses of genes as

                 basis for complex diseases. The plausibility of this
                 hypothesis depends on quantitative estimates of the prevalence
                 of mildly deleterious de novo mutations and polymorphic
                 variants in humans and on the intensity of selective pressure
                 against them. We combined analysis of mutations causing human
                 Mendelian diseases, of human-chimpanzee divergence, and of
                 systematic data on human genetic variation and found that
                 ~20\% of new missense mutations in humans result in a loss of
                 function, whereas ~27\% are effectively neutral. Thus, the
                 remaining 53\% of new missense mutations have mildly
                 deleterious effects. These mutations give rise to many
                 low-frequency deleterious allelic variants in the human
                 population, as is evident from a new data set of 37 genes
                 sequenced in >1,500 individual human chromosomes.
                 Surprisingly, up to 70\% of low-frequency missense alleles are
                 mildly deleterious and are associated with a heterozygous
                 fitness loss in the range 0.001-0.003. Thus, the low allele
                 frequency of an amino acid variant can, by itself, serve as a
                 predictor of its functional significance. Several recent
                 studies have reported a significant excess of rare missense
                 variants in candidate genes or pathways in individuals with
                 extreme values of quantitative phenotypes. These studies would
                 be unlikely to yield results if most rare variants were
                 neutral or if rare variants were not a significant contributor
                 to the genetic component of phenotypic inheritance. Our
                 results provide a justification for these types of
                 candidate-gene (pathway) association studies and imply that

                 purifying selection, with a small fraction of proteins
                 evolving under positive selection. The evolution at synonymous
                 positions in protein-coding genes is not nearly as well
                 understood, with the extent and types of selection remaining,
                 largely, unclear. A statistical test to identify purifying and
                 positive selection at synonymous sites in protein-coding genes
                 was developed. The method compares the rate of evolution at
                 synonymous sites (Ks) to that in intron sequences of the same
                 gene after sampling the aligned intron sequences to mimic the
                 statistical properties of coding sequences. We detected
                 purifying selection at synonymous sites in approximately 28\%
                 of the 1,562 analyzed orthologous genes from mouse and rat,
                 and positive selection in approximately 12\% of the genes.
                 Thus, the fraction of genes with readily detectable positive
                 selection at synonymous sites is much greater than the
                 fraction of genes with comparable positive selection at
                 nonsynonymous sites, i.e., at the level of the protein
                 sequence. Unlike other genes, the genes with positive
                 selection at synonymous sites showed no correlation between Ks
                 and the rate of evolution in nonsynonymous sites (Ka),
                 indicating that evolution of synonymous sites under positive
                 selection is decoupled from protein evolution. The genes with
                 purifying selection at synonymous sites showed significant
                 anticorrelation between Ks and expression level and breadth,
                 indicating that highly expressed genes evolve slowly. The
                 genes with positive selection at synonymous sites showed the
                 opposite trend, i.e., highly expressed genes had, on average,
                 higher Ks. For the genes with positive selection at synonymous
                 sites, a significantly lower mRNA stability is predicted
                 compared to the genes with negative selection. Thus, mRNA
                 destabilization could be an important factor driving positive
                 selection in nonsynonymous sites, probably, through regulation
                 of expression at the level of mRNA degradation and, possibly,
                 also translation rate. So, unexpectedly, we found that
                 positive selection at synonymous sites of mammalian genes is
                 substantially more common than positive selection at the level
                 of protein sequences. Positive selection at synonymous sites
                 might act through mRNA destabilization affecting mRNA levels
                 and translation.",

                 carrying silent SNPs in the MDR1 gene encoding P-glycoprotein
                 sometimes reveal altered P-glycoprotein pharmacokinetics.
                 There is no rational explanation for why silent SNPs might
                 have such effects, especially when no change in P-glycoprotein
                 mRNA and protein expression levels has been observed. The
                 purpose of this study was to perform careful ex vivo (in

                 (C1236T, G2677T C3435T) on P-glycoprotein expression and

                 mutation (C755G) in the human fibroblast growth factor

                 expected from average nucleotide substitution rates based on
                 evolutionary studies and the incidence of human genetic
                 diseases. To determine if this increased frequency was due to
                 the nucleotide site having the properties of a mutation hot
                 spot, or some other explanation, we developed a new
                 experimental approach. We examined the spatial distribution of
                 the frequency of the C755G mutation in the germline by
                 dividing four testes from two normal individuals each into
                 several hundred pieces, and, using a highly sensitive PCR
                 assay, we measured the mutation frequency of each piece. We
                 discovered that each testis was characterized by rare foci
                 with mutation frequencies 10(3) to >10(4) times higher than
                 the rest of the testis regions. Using a model based on what is
                 known about human germline development forced us to reject (p
                 < 10(-6)) the idea that the C755G mutation arises more
                 frequently because this nucleotide simply has a higher than
                 average mutation rate (hot spot model). This is true
                 regardless of whether mutation is dependent or independent of
                 cell division. An alternate model was examined where positive
                 selection acts on adult self-renewing Ap spermatogonial cells
                 (SrAp) carrying this mutation such that, instead of only
                 replacing themselves, they occasionally produce two SrAp
                 cells. This model could not be rejected given our observed
                 data. Unlike the disease site, similar analysis of C-to-G
                 mutations at a control nucleotide site in one testis pair
                 failed to find any foci with high mutation frequencies. The
                 rejection of the hot spot model and lack of rejection of a
                 selection model for the C755G mutation, along with other data,
                 provides strong support for the proposal that positive
                 selection in the testis can act to increase the frequency of
                 premeiotic germ cells carrying a mutation deleterious to an
                 offspring, thereby unfavorably altering the mutational load in
                 humans. Studying the anatomical distribution of germline

                 most common type of genetic variation in humans. However, the
                 factors that affect SNP density are poorly understood. The
                 goal of this study was to estimate the relative effects of
                 mutability and selection on SNP density in transcribed regions
                 of human genes. It is important for prediction of the regions
                 that harbor functional polymorphisms. RESULTS: We used
                 frequency-validated SNPs resulting from single-nucleotide
                 substitutions. SNPs were subdivided into five functional
                 categories: (i) 5' untranslated region (UTR) SNPs, (ii) 3' UTR
                 SNPs, (iii) synonymous SNPs, (iv) SNPs producing conservative
                 missense mutations, and (v) SNPs producing radical missense
                 mutations. Each of these categories was further subdivided
                 into nine mutational categories on the basis of the
                 single-nucleotide substitution type. Thus, 45
                 functional/mutational categories were analyzed. The relative
                 mutation rate in each mutational category was estimated on the
                 basis of published data. The proportion of segregating sites
                 (PSSs) for each functional/mutational category was estimated
                 by dividing the observed number of SNPs by the number of
                 potential sites in the genome for a given
                 functional/mutational category. By analyzing each functional
                 group separately, we found significant positive correlations
                 between PSSs and relative mutation rates (Spearman's
                 correlation coefficient, at least r = 0.96, df = 9, P <
                 0.001). We adjusted the PSSs for the mutation rate and found
                 that the functional category had a significant effect on SNP
                 density (F = 5.9, df = 4, P = 0.001), suggesting that
                 selection affects SNP density in transcribed regions of the
                 genome. We used analyses of variance and covariance to
                 estimate the relative effects of selection (functional
                 category) and mutability (relative mutation rate) on the PSSs
                 and found that approximately 87\% of variation in PSS was due
                 to variation in the mutation rate and approximately 13\% was
                 due to selection, suggesting that the probability that a site
                 located in a transcribed region of a gene is polymorphic
                 mostly depends on the mutability of the site.",

                 the non-coding portion of the human genome underlie much of
                 the phenotypic variability among humans and between humans and
                 other primates. If so, these genomic regions may be undergoing
                 rapid evolutionary change, due in part to natural selection.
                 However, the non-coding region is a heterogeneous mix of
                 functional and non-functional regions. Furthermore, the
                 functional regions are comprised of a variety of different
                 types of elements, each under potentially different selection
                 regimes. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using the HapMap and
                 Perlegen polymorphism data that map to a stringent set of
                 putative binding sites in human proximal promoters, we apply
                 the Derived Allele Frequency distribution test of neutrality
                 to provide evidence that many human-specific and
                 primate-specific binding sites are likely evolving under
                 positive selection. We also discuss inherent limitations of
                 publicly available human SNP datasets that complicate the
                 inference of selection pressures. Finally, we show that the
                 genes whose proximal binding sites contain high frequency
                 derived alleles are enriched for positive regulation of
                 protein metabolism and developmental processes. Thus our

                 human proximal promoters.",

                 structural variations, such as indels (insertions and
                 deletions), are common throughout the genome, but the
                 implications of structural variations are still not clearly
                 understood. Long tandem repeats (e.g. microsatellites or
                 simple repeats) are known to be hypermutable (indel-rich), but
                 are rare in exons and only occasionally associated with
                 diseases. Here we focus on short (imperfect) tandem repeats
                 (STRs) which fall below the radar of conventional tandem
                 repeat detection, and investigate whether STRs are targets for
                 disease-related mutations in human exons. In particular, we
                 test whether they share the hypermutability of the longer
                 tandem repeats and whether disease-related genes have a higher
                 STR content than non-disease-related genes.RESULTS:We show
                 that validated human indels are extremely common in STR
                 regions compared to non-STR regions. In contrast to longer
                 tandem repeats, our definition of STRs found them to be
                 present in exons of most known human genes (92\%), 99\% of all
                 STR sequences in exons are shorter than 33 base pairs and 62\%
                 of all STR sequences are imperfect repeats. We also
                 demonstrate that STRs are significantly overrepresented in
                 disease-related genes in both human and mouse. These results
                 are preserved when we limit the analysis to STRs outside known
                 longer tandem repeats.CONCLUSION:Based on our findings we
                 conclude that STRs represent hypermutable regions in the human
                 genome that are linked to human disease. In addition, STRs
                 constitute an obvious target when screening for rare
                 mutations, because of the relatively low amount of STRs in

                 Recent technological developments enable inexpensive and
                 accurate genotyping of a large number of SNPs in thousands of
                 cases and controls, which can provide adequate statistical
                 power to analyze SNPs with MAF <5\%. Our purpose was to
                 determine whether evaluating rare SNPs in case-control
                 association studies could help identify causal SNPs for common
                 diseases. We suggest that slightly deleterious SNPs (sdSNPs)
                 subjected to weak purifying selection are major players in
                 genetic control of susceptibility to common diseases. We
                 compared the distribution of MAFs of synonymous SNPs with that
                 of nonsynonymous SNPs (1) predicted to be benign, (2)
                 predicted to be possibly damaging, and (3) predicted to be
                 probably damaging by PolyPhen. Our sources of data were the
                 International HapMap Project, ENCODE, and the SeattleSNPs

                 probably damaging SNPs was shifted toward rare SNPs compared
                 with the MAF distribution of benign and synonymous SNPs that
                 are not likely to be functional. We also found an inverse
                 relationship between MAF and the proportion of nsSNPs
                 predicted to be protein disturbing. On the basis of this
                 relationship, we estimated the joint probability that a SNP is
                 functional and would be detected as significant in a
                 case-control study. Our analysis suggests that including rare

                 from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were often
                 selected for validation based on their functional annotation,
                 which was inadequate and biased. We propose to use the more
                 than 200,000 microarray studies in the Gene Expression Omnibus
                 to systematically prioritize candidate SNPs from GWASs.
                 RESULTS: We analyzed all human microarray studies from the
                 Gene Expression Omnibus, and calculated the observed frequency
                 of differential expression, which we called differential
                 expression ratio, for every human gene. Analysis conducted in
                 a comprehensive list of curated disease genes revealed a
                 positive association between differential expression ratio
                 values and the likelihood of harboring disease-associated
                 variants. By considering highly differentially expressed
                 genes, we were able to rediscover disease genes with 79\%
                 specificity and 37\% sensitivity. We successfully
                 distinguished true disease genes from false positives in
                 multiple GWASs for multiple diseases. We then derived a list
                 of functionally interpolating SNPs (fitSNPs) to analyze the
                 top seven loci of Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium type
                 1 diabetes mellitus GWASs, rediscovered all type 1 diabetes
                 mellitus genes, and predicted a novel gene (KIAA1109) for an
                 unexplained locus 4q27. We suggest that fitSNPs would work
                 equally well for both Mendelian and complex diseases (being
                 more effective for cancer) and proposed candidate genes to
                 sequence for their association with 597 syndromes with unknown
                 molecular basis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that
                 highly differentially expressed genes are more likely to
                 harbor disease-associated DNA variants. FitSNPs can serve as
                 an effective tool to systematically prioritize candidate SNPs

                 substitutions'', are a major mutational input into vertebrate
                 genomes and a leading cause of human genetic disease. The
                 prevalence of CpG substitutions is due to their mutational
                 origin, which is dependent on DNA methylation. In comparison,
                 other single nucleotide substitutions (for example those
                 occurring at GpC dinucleotides) mainly arise from errors
                 during DNA replication. Here we analyzed high quality
                 BAC-based data from human, chimpanzee, and baboon to
                 investigate regional variation of CpG substitution rates.We
                 show that CpG substitutions occur approximately 15 times more
                 frequently than other single nucleotide substitutions in
                 primate genomes, and that they exhibit substantial regional
                 variation. Patterns of CpG rate variation are consistent with
                 differences in methylation level and susceptibility to
                 subsequent deamination. In particular, we propose a
                 ``distance-decaying'' hypothesis, positing that due to the
                 molecular mechanism of a CpG substitution, rates are
                 correlated with the stability of double-stranded DNA
                 surrounding each CpG dinucleotide, and the effect of local DNA
                 stability may decrease with distance from the CpG
                 dinucleotide.Consistent with our ``distance-decaying''
                 hypothesis, rates of CpG substitution are strongly
                 (negatively) correlated with regional G+C content. The
                 influence of G+C content decays as the distance from the
                 target CpG site increases. We estimate that the influence of
                 local G+C content extends up to 1,500 approximately 2,000 bps
                 centered on each CpG site. We also show that the
                 distance-decaying relationship persisted when we controlled
                 for the effect of long-range homogeneity of nucleotide
                 composition. GpC sites, in contrast, do not exhibit such
                 ``distance-decaying'' relationship. Our results highlight an
                 example of the distinctive properties of methylation-dependent
                 substitutions versus substitutions mostly arising from errors
                 during DNA replication. Furthermore, the negative relationship
                 between G+C content and CpG rates may provide an explanation
                 for the observation that GC-rich SINEs show lower CpG rates

                 Many such mutations are complex; that is, they consist of
                 multiple close sequence changes. Current models posit that the
                 primer terminus of a replicating DNA molecule dissociates,
                 reanneals with an ectopic template, extends briefly, and then
                 returns to the cognate template, bringing with it a locally
                 different sequence; alternatively, a hairpin structure may
                 form the mutational intermediate when processed by mismatch
                 repair. This process resembles replication repair, in which
                 primer extension is blocked by a lesion in the template; in
                 this case, the ectopic template is the other daughter strand,
                 and the result is error-free bypass of the lesion. We
                 previously showed that mutations that impair replication

                 the intensity of templated mutation can be exquisitely
                 sensitive to its local sequence, that the donor and recipient
                 arms of an imperfect inverse repeat can exchange roles, and
                 that double mutants carrying two alleles, each affecting both
                 templated mutagenesis and replication repair, can have
                 unexpected phenotypes. We also record an instance in which the
                 mutation rates at two particular sites change concordantly
                 with a distant sequence change, but in a manner that appears

                 clinical conditions and measurable traits. Since 2005, nearly
                 100 loci for as many as 40 common diseases and traits have
                 been identified and replicated in GWA studies, many in genes
                 not previously suspected of having a role in the disease under
                 study, and some in genomic regions containing no known genes.
                 GWA studies are an important advance in discovering genetic
                 variants influencing disease but also have important
                 limitations, including their potential for false-positive and
                 false-negative results and for biases related to selection of
                 study participants and genotyping errors. Although these
                 studies are clearly many steps removed from actual clinical
                 use, and specific applications of GWA findings in prevention
                 and treatment are actively being pursued, at present these

  abstract    = "One of the most useful tools for investigating the
                 aetiopathology of cancer is the mutation spectrum, which
                 comprises the type and distribution of mutations within a gene
                 sequence. Many studies have generated mutagen-induced spectra
                 using in vitro or in vivo model systems in an attempt to find
                 correlations with those observed in cancer-associated genes
                 such as the TP53 tumour suppressor gene. Consequently,
                 meaningful similarities in the types of mutation found in
                 induced and human spectra have been demonstrated. However, it
                 is more difficult to draw such conclusions about the
                 distribution or sequence context of mutations when they arise
                 in different target sequences. We have developed an analytical
                 approach for base substitution spectra that capture
                 information for both sequence context and mutation type
                 simultaneously. The resulting mutation signature is a fixed
                 set of data points that allows comparison of multiple mutation
                 spectra regardless of sequence. We have applied this method to
                 a mixed set of mutation spectra observed in exons 5, 7 and 8
                 of TP53 from cancers of brain, breast, skin, colon,

                 and mutagen-induced signatures to be grouped together
                 according to similarity. Specifically, the analysis reveals
                 key differences between smoking- and non-smoking-related lung
                 cancer for TP53 mutations and the mutability of CpG sites

                 approximately 20\% of disease-associated single-basepair
                 substitutions affecting gene coding regions. Pathological
                 nonsense mutations resulting in TGA (38.5\%), TAG (40.4\%),
                 and TAA (21.1\%) occur in different proportions to naturally
                 occurring stop codons. Of the 23 different nucleotide
                 substitutions giving rise to nonsense mutations, the most
                 frequent are CGA --> TGA (21\%; resulting from
                 methylation-mediated deamination) and CAG --> TAG (19\%). The
                 differing nonsense mutation frequencies are largely explicable
                 in terms of variable nucleotide substitution rates such that
                 it is unnecessary to invoke differential translational
                 termination efficiency or differential codon usage. Some genes
                 are characterized by numerous nonsense mutations but
                 relatively few if any missense mutations (e.g., CHM) whereas
                 other genes exhibit many missense mutations but few if any
                 nonsense mutations (e.g., PSEN1). Genes in the latter category
                 have a tendency to encode proteins characterized by multimer
                 formation. Consistent with the operation of a clinical
                 selection bias, genes exhibiting an excess of nonsense
                 mutations are also likely to display an excess of frameshift
                 mutations. Tumor suppressor (TS) genes exhibit a
                 disproportionate number of nonsense mutations while most
                 mutations in oncogenes are missense. A total of 12\% of
                 somatic nonsense mutations in TS genes were found to occur
                 recurrently in the hypermutable CpG dinucleotide. In a
                 comparison of somatic and germline mutational spectra for 17
                 TS genes, approximately 43\% of somatic nonsense mutations had
                 counterparts in the germline (rising to 98\% for CpG
                 mutations). Finally, the proportion of disease-causing
                 nonsense mutations predicted to elicit nonsense-mediated mRNA
                 decay (NMD) is significantly higher (P=1.56 x 10(-9)) than

                 distribution of single-nucleotide changes around
                 insertions/deletions (indels) in six independent genome
                 comparisons, including primates, rodents, fruitfly, rice and

                 divergence (D) is substantially elevated surrounding indels
                 and decreases monotonically to near-background levels over
                 several hundred bases. D is significantly correlated with both
                 size and abundance of nearby indels. In comparisons of closely
                 related species, derived nucleotide substitutions surrounding

                 C758G) are responsible for virtually all sporadic cases of
                 Apert syndrome. This condition is 100-1,000 times more common
                 than genomic mutation frequency data predict. Here, we report
                 on the C758G de novo Apert syndrome mutation. Using data on
                 older donors, we show that spontaneous mutations are not
                 uniformly distributed throughout normal testes. Instead, we
                 find foci where C758G mutation frequencies are 3-4 orders of
                 magnitude greater than the remaining tissue. We conclude this
                 nucleotide site is not a mutation hot spot even after
                 accounting for possible Luria-Delbruck ``mutation jackpots.''
                 An alternative explanation for such foci involving positive
                 selection acting on adult self-renewing Ap spermatogonia
                 experiencing the rare mutation could not be rejected. Further,
                 the two youngest individuals studied (19 and 23 years old) had
                 lower mutation frequencies and smaller foci at both mutation
                 sites compared with the older individuals. This implies that
                 the mutation frequency of foci increases as adults age, and
                 thus selection could explain the paternal age effect for Apert
                 syndrome and other genetic conditions. Our results, now
                 including the analysis of two mutations in the same set of
                 testes, suggest that positive selection can increase the
                 relative frequency of premeiotic germ cells carrying such
                 mutations, although individuals who inherit them have reduced
                 fitness. In addition, we compared the anatomical distribution

                 genes appear to be involved. The combinatorial patterns of
                 gene mutations may reveal the functional relations between
                 genes and pathways in tumorigenesis as well as identify
                 targets for treatment. We examined the patterns of somatic
                 mutations of cancers from Catalog of Somatic Mutations in
                 Cancer (COSMIC), a large-scale database curated by the
                 Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The frequently mutated genes
                 are well-known oncogenes and tumor suppressors that are
                 involved in generic processes of cell-cycle control, signal
                 transduction, and stress responses. These ``signatures'' of
                 gene mutations are heterogeneous when the cancers from
                 different tissues are compared. Mutations in genes functioning
                 in different pathways can occur in the same cancer (i.e.,
                 co-occur), whereas those in genes functioning in the same
                 pathway are rarely mutated in the same sample. This
                 observation supports the view of tumorigenesis as derived from
                 a process like Darwinian evolution. However, certain
                 combinatorial mutational patterns violate these simple rules
                 and demonstrate tissue-specific variations. For instance,
                 mutations of genes in the Ras and Wnt pathways tend to
                 co-occur in the large intestine but are mutually exclusive in
                 cancers of the pancreas. The relationships between mutations
                 in different samples of a cancer can also reveal the temporal
                 orders of mutational events. In addition, the observed
                 mutational patterns suggest candidates of new cosequencing
                 targets that can either reveal novel patterns or validate the
                 predictions deduced from existing patterns. These
                 combinatorial mutational patterns provide guiding information

                 significantly to a person's phenotype, thereby enabling
                 personalized genomics. We focus here on the variants in a
                 person's 'exome,' which is the set of exons in a genome,
                 because the exome is believed to harbor much of the functional
                 variation. We provide an analysis of the approximately 12,500
                 variants that affect the protein coding portion of an
                 individual's genome. We identified approximately 10,400
                 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in this
                 individual, of which approximately 15-20\% are rare in the
                 human population. We predict approximately 1,500 nsSNPs affect
                 protein function and these tend be heterozygous, rare, or
                 novel. Of the approximately 700 coding indels, approximately
                 half tend to have lengths that are a multiple of three, which
                 causes insertions/deletions of amino acids in the
                 corresponding protein, rather than introducing frameshifts.
                 Coding indels also occur frequently at the termini of genes,
                 so even if an indel causes a frameshift, an alternative start
                 or stop site in the gene can still be used to make a
                 functional protein. In summary, we reduced the set of
                 approximately 12,500 nonsilent coding variants by
                 approximately 8-fold to a set of variants that are most likely
                 to have major effects on their proteins' functions. This is
                 our first glimpse of an individual's exome and a snapshot of
                 the current state of personalized genomics. The majority of
                 coding variants in this individual are common and appear to be

                 variants can be used to improve the current NCBI human
                 reference genome. As more genomes are sequenced, many rare

                 insights into several of the biochemical functions disrupted
                 by disease-causing mutations. Currently, there are more than
                 60 000 coding-region mutations associated with inherited
                 disease catalogued in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD,
                 August 2007) and more than 70 000 polymorphic amino acid
                 substitutions recorded in dbSNP (dbSNP, build 127).
                 Understanding the mechanism and contribution these variants
                 make to a clinical phenotype is a formidable problem. RESULTS:
                 In this study, we investigate the role of phosphorylation in
                 somatic cancer mutations and inherited diseases. Somatic
                 cancer mutation datasets were shown to have a significant
                 enrichment for mutations that cause gain or loss of
                 phosphorylation when compared to our control datasets
                 (putatively neutral nsSNPs and random amino acid
                 substitutions). Of the somatic cancer mutations, those in
                 kinase genes represent the most enriched set of mutations that
                 disrupt phosphorylation sites, suggesting phosphorylation
                 target site mutation is an active cause of phosphorylation
                 deregulation. Overall, this evidence suggests both gain and
                 loss of a phosphorylation site in a target protein may be
                 important features for predicting cancer-causing mutations and

                 performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic
                 cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219
                 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in
                 these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and
                 amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays
                 containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide
                 polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an
                 average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are
                 point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12
                 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each
                 genetically altered in 67 to 100\% of the tumors. Analysis of
                 these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation
                 sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent
                 evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes.
                 Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and
                 regulatory processes only become evident once the coding
                 regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of
                 these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain
                 the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.",

                 of a specific type of epistasis, namely the interaction
                 between regulatory and protein-coding variants. Using genotype
                 and gene expression data from the 210 unrelated individuals of
                 the original four HapMap populations, we have explored the
                 combined effects of regulatory and protein-coding single
                 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We predict that about 18\%
                 (1,502 out of 8,233 nsSNPs) of protein-coding variants are
                 differentially expressed among individuals and demonstrate

                 way, a cis interaction between regulatory and protein-coding

                 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with
                 known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than
                 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis
                 identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high
                 frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis.
                 The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among
                 them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes,
                 notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor

                 and the local sequence context of a site. In particular, CpG
                 context elevates the mutation rate by an order of magnitude.
                 Mutations also vary widely in their effect on the molecular
                 function, phenotype, and fitness. Independence of the
                 probability of occurrence of a new mutation's effect has been
                 a fundamental premise in genetics. However, highly mutable
                 contexts may be preserved by negative selection at important
                 sites but destroyed by mutation at sites under no selection.
                 Thus, there may be a positive correlation between the rate of
                 mutations at a nucleotide site and the magnitude of their
                 effect on fitness. We studied the impact of CpG context on the
                 rate of human-chimpanzee divergence and on intrahuman
                 nucleotide diversity at non-synonymous coding sites. We
                 compared nucleotides that occupy identical positions within
                 codons of identical amino acids and only differ by being
                 within versus outside CpG context. Nucleotides within CpG
                 context are under a stronger negative selection, as revealed
                 by their lower, proportionally to the mutation rate, rate of
                 evolution and nucleotide diversity. In particular, the
                 probability of fixation of a non-synonymous transition at a
                 CpG site is two times lower than at a CpG site. Thus, sites
                 with different mutation rates are not necessarily selectively
                 equivalent. This suggests that the mutation rate may

                 consequences and eventual clinical significance of a sequence
                 variant is not an easy task. Computational approaches have
                 found perturbation of conserved amino acids to be a useful
                 criterion for identifying variants likely to have phenotypic
                 consequences. To our knowledge, however, no study to date has

                 Moreover, if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing,

  abstract    = "Although previous studies have failed to detect an association
                 between microsatellite polymorphism and broadscale
                 recombination rates in the human genome, there are several
                 possible reasons why such a relationship could exist. For
                 instance, there might be a direct link if recombination is
                 mutagenic to microsatellite sequences or if polymorphic
                 microsatellites act as recombination signals. Alternatively,
                 recombination could exert an indirect effect by uncoupling of
                 natural selection at linked loci, promoting polymorphism. As
                 recombination is concentrated in narrow hotspot regions in the
                 human genome, we investigated the relationship between
                 microsatellite polymorphism and recombination hot spots. By
                 using data from a common allele frequency database, we found
                 several polymorphism estimates to be similar for hot spots and
                 the genomic average. However, this is likely explained by an
                 ascertainment bias because markers with high polymorphism
                 information content are usually selected for genotyping in
                 human populations and pedigrees. In contrast, by using an
                 unbiased set of shotgun sequence data, we found an excess of
                 microsatellite polymorphism in recombination hot spots of
                 14\%. However, when other genomic variables are taken into
                 account in a generalized model and using wavelet analysis, the
                 effect is no longer detectable and the only firm predictor of
                 microsatellite polymorphism is the incidence of SNPs and
                 indels. One possible neutral explanation to these observations
                 is that there is a common denominator affecting the local rate
                 of mutation in unique as well as in repetitive DNA, for
                 example, base composition.",

                 (> or = 1 kb) genomic regions of high sequence identity (> or
                 = 90\%). They cover approximately 4-5\% of the human genome
                 and play important roles in gene evolution and genomic
                 disease. The DNA sequence differences between copies of a
                 segmental duplication represent the result of various
                 mutational events over time, since any two duplication copies
                 originated from the same ancestral DNA sequence. Based on this
                 fact, we have developed a computational scheme for inference
                 of point mutational events in human segmental duplications,
                 which we collectively term duplication-inferred mutations
                 (DIMs). We have characterized these nucleotide substitutions
                 by comparing them with high-quality SNPs from dbSNP, both in
                 terms of sequence context and frequency of substitution
                 types.RESULTS:Overall, DIMs show a lower ratio of transitions
                 relative to transversions than SNPs, although this ratio
                 approaches that of SNPs when considering DIMs within most
                 recent duplications. Our findings indicate that DIMs and SNPs
                 in general are caused by similar mutational mechanisms, with
                 some deviances at the CpG dinucleotide. Furthermore, we
                 discover a large number of reference SNPs that coincide with
                 computationally inferred DIMs. The latter reflects how
                 sequence variation in duplicated sequences can be
                 misinterpreted as ordinary allelic variation.CONCLUSION:In
                 summary, we show how DNA sequence analysis of segmental
                 duplications can provide a genome-wide mutational spectrum
                 that mirrors recent genome evolution. The inferred set of
                 nucleotide substitutions represents a valuable complement to

                 on the sequence as well as intramolecular structure of the
                 transcript. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) can
                 contribute to alterations in the structure of regions flanking
                 them, thereby influencing the accessibility for miRNA binding.
                 DESCRIPTION: The entire human genome was analyzed for SNPs in
                 and around predicted miRNA target sites. Polymorphisms within
                 200 nucleotides that could alter the intramolecular structure
                 at the target site, thereby altering regulation were

               common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
               terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these
               areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is
               statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than
               mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of
               color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and
               anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The
               book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
               to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural
               networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
               boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in
               any book. This major new edition features many topics not
               covered in the original, including graphical models, random
               forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path
               algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and
               spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for

                 We investigated whether there is additional variation by
                 testing whether there is an excess of sites at which both
                 humans and chimpanzees have a single-nucleotide polymorphism

                 selection. We therefore infer that there is cryptic variation
                 in the mutation rate. However, although this variation in the

                 side of sites with coincident SNPs, suggesting that there are

                 improve drug efficacy. Advancements in the miRNA field

                 regulation of the cell can be present not only in the 3 -UTR

                 architecture in Eukaryotes has long been hampered by the
                 scarcity of experimental data. Recent work, relying on
                 computational predictions of origins of replication, suggested
                 that replication might be a major determinant of gene
                 organization in human (Huvet et al. 2007. Human gene
                 organization driven by the coordination of replication and
                 transcription. Genome Res. 17:1278-1285). Here, we address
                 this question by analyzing the first large-scale data set of
                 experimentally determined origins of replication in human: 283
                 origins identified in HeLa cells, in 1\% of the genome covered
                 by ENCODE regions (Cadoret et al. 2008. Genome-wide studies

                 gene regulation. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 105:15837-15842). We
                 show that origins of replication are not randomly distributed
                 as they display significant overlap with promoter regions and
                 CpG islands. The hypothesis of a selective pressure to avoid
                 frontal collisions between replication and transcription
                 polymerases is not supported by experimental data as we find
                 no evidence for gene orientation bias in the proximity of
                 origins of replication. The lack of a significant orientation
                 bias remains manifest even when considering only genes
                 expressed at a high rate, or in a wide number of tissues, and
                 is not affected by the regional replication timing. Gene
                 expression breadth does not appear to be correlated with the
                 distance from the origins of replication. We conclude that the

                 context contributes to these differences. To investigate the
                 relative impact of various molecular mechanisms to indel
                 formation, we analyzed sequence contexts of indels in the non
                 protein- or RNA-coding, nonrepetitive (NCNR) portion of the
                 human genome. We considered small (</=30-bp) indels occurring
                 in the human lineage since its divergence from chimpanzee and
                 used wavelet techniques to study, simultaneously for multiple
                 scales, the spatial patterns of short sequence motifs
                 associated with indel mutagenesis. In particular, we focused
                 on motifs associated with DNA polymerase activity,
                 topoisomerase cleavage, double-strand breaks (DSBs), and their
                 repair. We came to the following conclusions. First, many
                 motifs are characterized by unique enrichment profiles in the
                 vicinity of indels vs. indel-free portions of the genome,
                 verifying the importance of sequence context in indel
                 mutagenesis. Second, only limited similarity in motif
                 frequency profiles is evident flanking insertions vs.
                 deletions, confirming differences in their mutagenesis. Third,
                 substantial similarity in frequency profiles exists between
                 pairs of individual motifs flanking insertions (and separately
                 deletions), suggesting ``cooperation'' among motifs, and thus
                 molecular mechanisms, during indel formation. Fourth, the
                 wavelet analyses demonstrate that all these patterns are
                 highly dependent on scale (the size of an interval
                 considered). Finally, our results depict a model of indel
                 mutagenesis comprising both replication and recombination (via
                 repair of paused replication forks and site-specific
                 recombination).",

                 considerable potential to form four-stranded structures known
                 as G-quadruplexes or G4 DNA. The enrichment of these motifs in
                 key chromosomal regions has suggested a functional role for
                 the G-quadruplex structure in genomic regulation. In this
                 work, we have examined the spectrum of nucleotide
                 substitutions in G4 motifs, and related this spectrum to G4
                 prevalence. Data collected from the large repository of human
                 SNPs indicates that the core feature of G-quadruplex motifs,
                 5'-GGG-3', exhibits specific mutational patterns that preserve
                 the potential for G4 formation. In particular, we find a
                 genome-wide pattern in which sites that disrupt the guanine
                 triplets are more conserved and less polymorphic than their
                 neutral counterparts. This also holds when considering non-CpG
                 sites only. However, the low level of polymorphisms in guanine

                 short guanine tracts are the most under-represented sequence

                 hypermutability is a general mutational mechanism with the
                 potential to generate multiple synchronous mutations, a
                 phenomenon probably best exemplified by closely spaced
                 multiple mutations (CSMMs). Here we have attempted to extend
                 the concept of transient hypermutability from somatic cells to
                 the germline, using human inherited disease-causing multiple
                 mutations as a model system. Employing stringent criteria for
                 data inclusion, we have retrospectively identified numerous
                 potential examples of pathogenic CSMMs that exhibit marked
                 similarities to the CSMMs reported in other systems. These
                 examples include (1) eight multiple mutations, each comprising
                 three or more components within a sequence tract of <100 bp;
                 (2) three possible instances of ``mutation showers''; and (3)
                 numerous highly informative ``homocoordinate'' mutations.
                 Using the proportion of CpG substitution as a crude indicator
                 of the relative likelihood of transient hypermutability, we
                 present evidence to suggest that CSMMs comprising at least one
                 pair of mutations separated by < or =100 bp may constitute
                 signatures of transient hypermutability in human genes.

                 by the small number (approximately 30) of well-established
                 origins in the human genome and more generally in mammalian
                 genomes. Recent in silico studies of compositional strand
                 asymmetries revealed a high level of organization of human
                 genes around 1000 putative replication origins. Here, by
                 comparing with recently experimentally identified replication
                 origins, we provide further support that these putative
                 origins are active in vivo. We show that regions approximately
                 300-kb wide surrounding most of these putative replication
                 origins that replicate early in the S phase are hypersensitive

                 polymorphisms (RLPs) in human genomes and a comparison of the
                 rate of polymorphism in humans versus divergence from

                 genomes reveals a relatively low RLP rate in exons and,
                 somewhat surprisingly, in introns. All short RLPs observed in
                 multiple genomes are biallelic (at least in this small

                 some long RLPs are multiallelic. For long repeats, the

                 the genetic basis of common diseases. An open question is
                 whether the allele frequency distributions and ancestral vs.
                 derived states of disease-associated alleles differ from the
                 rest of the genome. Characteristics of disease-associated
                 alleles can be used to increase the yield of future
                 studies.METHODS:The set of all common disease-associated
                 alleles found in genome-wide association studies prior to
                 January 2010 was analyzed and compared with HapMap and
                 theoretical null expectations. In addition, allele frequency
                 distributions of different disease classes were assessed. Ages
                 of HapMap and disease-associated alleles were also
                 estimated.RESULTS:The allele frequency distribution of HapMap
                 alleles was qualitatively similar to neutral expectations.
                 However, disease-associated alleles were more likely to be low
                 frequency derived alleles relative to null expectations.
                 43.7\% of disease-associated alleles were ancestral alleles.
                 The mean frequency of disease-associated alleles was less than
                 randomly chosen CEU HapMap alleles (0.394 vs. 0.610, after
                 accounting for probability of detection). Similar patterns
                 were observed for the subset of disease-associated alleles
                 that have been verified in multiple studies. SNPs implicated
                 in genome-wide association studies were enriched for young
                 SNPs compared to randomly selected HapMap loci. Odds ratios of
                 disease-associated alleles tended to be less than 1.5 and
                 varied by frequency, confirming previous
                 studies.CONCLUSIONS:Alleles associated with genetic disease
                 differ from randomly selected HapMap alleles and neutral
                 expectations. The evolutionary history of alleles (frequency
                 and ancestral vs. derived state) influences whether they are

                 divergences between populations and maintaining polymorphisms
                 within populations has been a central issue. A variety of
                 statistical methods has been developed for detecting natural
                 selection operating at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence
                 levels. These methods may be largely classified into those
                 aimed at detecting recurrent and/or recent/ongoing natural
                 selection by utilizing the divergence and/or polymorphism
                 data. Using these methods, pervasive positive selection has
                 been identified for protein-coding and non-coding sequences in
                 the genomic analysis of some organisms. However, many of these
                 methods have been criticized by using computer simulation and
                 real data analysis to produce excessive false-positives and to
                 be sensitive to various disturbing factors. Importantly, some
                 of these methods have been invalidated experimentally. These
                 facts indicate that many of the statistical methods for
                 detecting natural selection are unreliable. In addition, the
                 signals that have been believed as the evidence for fixations
                 of advantageous mutations due to positive selection may also
                 be interpreted as the evidence for fixations of deleterious
                 mutations due to random genetic drift. The genomic diversity
                 data are rapidly accumulating in various organisms, and
                 detection of natural selection may play a critical role for
                 clarifying the relative role of random genetic drift and
                 positive selection in molecular and phenotypic evolution. It

                 cancer with comprehensive genomic profiles mapped by The
                 Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. A central challenge in
                 large-scale genome projects, such as the TCGA GBM project, is
                 the ability to distinguish cancer-causing ``driver'' mutations
                 from passively selected ``passenger'' mutations.PRINCIPAL
                 FINDINGS:In contrast to a purely frequency based approach to
                 identifying driver mutations in cancer, we propose an
                 automated network-based approach for identifying candidate
                 oncogenic processes and driver genes. The approach is based on
                 the hypothesis that cellular networks contain functional
                 modules, and that tumors target specific modules critical to
                 their growth. Key elements in the approach include combined
                 analysis of sequence mutations and DNA copy number
                 alterations; use of a unified molecular interaction network
                 consisting of both protein-protein interactions and signaling
                 pathways; and identification and statistical assessment of
                 network modules, i.e. cohesive groups of genes of interest
                 with a higher density of interactions within groups than
                 between groups.CONCLUSIONS:We confirm and extend the
                 observation that GBM alterations tend to occur within specific
                 functional modules, in spite of considerable
                 patient-to-patient variation, and that two of the largest
                 modules involve signaling via p53, Rb, PI3K and receptor

                 are some sites that are triallelic. We show here that there
                 are approximately twice as many triallelic sites as we would
                 expect by chance. This excess does not appear to be caused by
                 natural selection or mutational hotspots. Instead we propose
                 that a new mutation can induce another mutation either within
                 the same individual or subsequently during recombination. We
                 provide evidence for this model by showing that the rarer two
                 alleles at triallelic sites tend to cluster on phylogenetic
                 trees of human haplotypes. However, we find no association
                 between the density of triallelic sites and the rate of
                 recombination, which leads us to suggest that triallelic sites
                 might be generated by the simultaneous production of two new
                 mutations within the same individual on the same genetic
                 background. Under this model we estimate that simultaneous
                 mutation contributes approximately 3\% of all distinct SNPs.
                 We also show that there is a twofold excess of adjacent SNPs.
                 Approximately half of these seem to be generated
                 simultaneously since they have identical minor allele
                 frequencies. We estimate that the mutation of adjacent

                 and its subgroups - mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with
                 hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) and TLE with antecedent
                 febrile seizures (TLE-FS) - is poorly understood. It has been
                 proposed that the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the
                 potassium channel Kir4.1 (KCNJ10 gene) act in concert to
                 regulate extracellular K(+) homeostasis and that functional
                 alterations of these channels influence neuronal excitability.
                 The current study was designed to identify variants of the
                 AQP4 and KCNJ10 genes associated with TLE and subgroups of
                 this condition.MATERIAL AND METHODS:We included 218 Norwegian
                 patients with TLE and 181 ethnically matched healthy controls.
                 An association study was established in which all TLE patients
                 were compared with healthy controls. Additionally, subgroups
                 of 56 MTLE-HS patients were compared with 162 TLE patients
                 without HS, and 102 TLE-FS patients were compared with 105 TLE
                 without FS.RESULTS:We found eight single SNPs, seven in KCNJ10
                 and one between KCNJ10 and KCNJ9, associated with TLE-FS
                 (nominal p-values from 0.009 to 0.041). Seven of the SNPs
                 segregate into one large haplotype block expanding from KCNJ10
                 to KCNJ9, including the region interposed those genes. One
                 haplotype was overrepresented in the TLE-FS cases (nominal
                 p-value 0.014). These results were confirmed by explorative
                 multivariate analysis indicating that a combination of SNPs
                 from KCNJ10, the region between KCNJ10 and KCNJ9, and the AQP4
                 gene is associated with TLE-FS. For the TLE cohort as a whole,
                 explorative multivariate analysis indicated a combination of
                 SNPs from the KCNJ10 and AQP4 genes in association with

                 TLE-FS, supporting the suggestion that perturbations of water

                 fertility, an increased incidence of miscarriage and an
                 enhanced risk of disease in the offspring. The origins of this
                 DNA damage could, in principle, involve: (i) abortive
                 apoptosis initiated post meiotically when the ability to drive
                 this process to completion is in decline (ii) unresolved
                 strand breaks created during spermiogenesis to relieve the
                 torsional stresses associated with chromatin remodelling and
                 (iii) oxidative stress. In this article, we present a two-step
                 hypothesis for the origins of DNA damage in human spermatozoa
                 that highlights the significance of oxidative stress acting on
                 vulnerable, poorly protaminated cells generated as a result of
                 defective spermiogenesis. We further propose that these
                 defective cells are characterized by several hallmarks of
                 'dysmaturity' including the retention of excess residual
                 cytoplasm, persistent nuclear histones, poor zona binding and
                 disrupted chaperone content. The oxidative stress experienced
                 by these cells may originate from infiltrating leukocytes or,
                 possibly, the entry of spermatozoa into an apoptosis-like
                 cascade characterized by the mitochondrial generation of
                 reactive oxygen species. This oxidative stress may be
                 exacerbated by a decline in local antioxidant protection,
                 particularly during epididymal maturation. Finally, if
                 oxidative stress is a major cause of sperm DNA damage then
                 antioxidants should have an important therapeutic role to play
                 in the clinical management of male infertility. Carefully
                 controlled studies are now needed to critically examine this

                 disease-associated mutations in intergenic and non-coding
                 regions of the genome. Given the high percentage of the human
                 genome that is transcribed, we postulate that for some
                 observed associations the disease phenotype is caused by a
                 structural rearrangement in a regulatory region of the RNA
                 transcript. To identify such mutations, we have performed a
                 genome-wide analysis of all known disease-associated Single
                 Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Human Gene Mutation
                 Database (HGMD) that map to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of
                 a gene. Rather than using minimum free energy approaches (e.g.
                 mFold), we use a partition function calculation that takes
                 into consideration the ensemble of possible RNA conformations
                 for a given sequence. We identified in the human genome
                 disease-associated SNPs that significantly alter the global
                 conformation of the UTR to which they map. For six
                 disease-states (Hyperferritinemia Cataract Syndrome,
                 beta-Thalassemia, Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia, Retinoblastoma,
                 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and
                 Hypertension), we identified multiple SNPs in UTRs that alter
                 the mRNA structural ensemble of the associated genes. Using a
                 Boltzmann sampling procedure for sub-optimal RNA structures,
                 we are able to characterize and visualize the nature of the
                 conformational changes induced by the disease-associated
                 mutations in the structural ensemble. We observe in several
                 cases (specifically the 5' UTRs of FTL and RB1) SNP-induced
                 conformational changes analogous to those observed in
                 bacterial regulatory Riboswitches when specific ligands bind.
                 We propose that the UTR and SNP combinations we identify
                 constitute a ``RiboSNitch,'' that is a regulatory RNA in which
                 a specific SNP has a structural consequence that results in a
                 disease phenotype. Our SNPfold algorithm can help identify
                 RiboSNitches by leveraging GWAS data and an analysis of the

                 Tumor-specific length alterations within microsatellites are
                 generally accepted to be a consequence of strand slippage
                 events during DNA replication, which are uncorrected due to a

                 Mutations arising within microsatellites associated with
                 critical target genes are believed to play a causative role in

                 stability or genetic variability is a fundamental problem in
                 evolutionary biology. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that
                 selection favors genetic stability by avoiding unstable
                 nucleotide sequences in protein encoding DNA. Yet, such
                 unstable sequences are maintained in several DNA repair genes,
                 thereby promoting breakdown of repair and destabilizing the
                 genome. Several studies have therefore argued that selection
                 favors genetic variability at the expense of stability. Here
                 we propose a new evolutionary mechanism, with supporting
                 bioinformatic evidence, that resolves this paradox. Combining
                 the concepts of gene-dependent mutation biases and meiotic
                 recombination, we argue that unstable sequences in the DNA
                 mismatch repair (MMR) genes are maintained by their own
                 phenotype. In particular, we predict that human MMR maintains
                 an overrepresentation of mononucleotide repeats (monorepeats)
                 within and around the MMR genes. In support of this
                 hypothesis, we report a 31\% excess in monorepeats in 250 kb
                 regions surrounding the seven MMR genes compared to all other
                 RefSeq genes (1.75 vs. 1.34\%, P = 0.0047), with a
                 particularly high content in PMS2 (2.41\%, P = 0.0047) and
                 MSH6 (2.07\%, P = 0.043). Based on a mathematical model of
                 monorepeat frequency, we argue that the proposed mechanism may
                 suffice to explain the observed excess of repeats around MMR
                 genes. Our findings thus indicate that unstable sequences in
                 MMR genes are maintained through evolution by the MMR
                 mechanism. The evolutionary paradox of genetically unstable
                 DNA repair genes may thus be explained by an equilibrium in
                 which the phenotype acts back on its own genotype.",

                 introduce a new computational framework to suggest possible
                 consequences of sequence variations on regulatory networks.
                 Our method, called sTRAP (strap.molgen.mpg.de), analyses
                 variations in the DNA sequence and predicts quantitative
                 changes to the binding strength of any transcription factor
                 for which there is a binding model. We have tested the method
                 against a set of known associations between SNPs and their
                 regulatory consequences. Our predictions are robust with
                 respect to different parameters and model assumptions.
                 Importantly we set an objective and quantifiable benchmark

                 but the clinical translation of genetic risk estimates remains
                 unclear. We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a
                 complete human genome in a clinical context.METHODS:We
                 assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease
                 and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis
                 of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for
                 coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden
                 cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis
                 included the development of novel methods for the integration
                 of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis
                 focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated
                 with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and
                 pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific
                 mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify
                 genes and mutations with known associations with disease and
                 drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease
                 by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of
                 multiple common variants to age-appropriate and
                 sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for
                 gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent
                 risks.FINDINGS:Analysis of 2.6 million single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased
                 genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and
                 some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that
                 are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43,
                 DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family
                 history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a
                 heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable
                 clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a
                 positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in
                 CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial

                 non-randomly in the human genome through a variety of
                 processes from ascertainment biases (i.e. the preferential
                 development of SNPs around interesting genes) to the action of
                 mutation hotspots and natural selection. However, with more
                 systematic SNP development, one might expect an increasing
                 proportion of SNPs to be distributed more or less randomly.
                 Here, I test this null hypothesis using stochastic simulations
                 and compare this output with that of an alternative hypothesis
                 that mutations are more likely to occur near existing SNPs, a
                 possibility suggested both by molecular studies of meiotic
                 mismatch repair in yeast and by data showing that SNPs cluster
                 around heterozygous deletions. A purely Poisson process
                 generates SNP clusters that differ from equivalent data from
                 human chromosome 1 in both the frequency of different-sized
                 clusters and the SNP density within each cluster, even for
                 small clusters of just four or five SNPs, while clusters on
                 the X chromosome differ from those on the autosomes. In
                 contrast, modest levels of mutational non-independence
                 generate a reasonable fit to the real data for both cluster
                 frequency and density, and also exhibit the evolutionary
                 transience noted for 'mutation hotspots'. Mutational
                 non-independence therefore provides an interesting new
                 hypothesis that appears capable of explaining the distribution
                 of SNPs in the human genome.",

                 primary lung tumour (60x coverage) and adjacent normal tissue
                 (46x). Comparing the two genomes, we identify a wide variety

                 involved in numerous human genetic diseases. In this study, we
                 searched the human genome reference sequence and annotated
                 exons (exome) for the presence of uninterrupted triplet repeat
                 tracts composed of six or more repeated units. A list of 32
                 448 TNRs and 878 TNR-containing genes was generated and is
                 provided herein. We found that some triplet repeats,
                 specifically CNG, are overrepresented, while CTT, ATC, AAC and
                 AAT are underrepresented in exons. This observation suggests
                 that the occurrence of TNRs in exons is not random, but
                 undergoes positive or negative selective pressure.
                 Additionally, TNR types strongly determine their localization
                 in mRNA sections (ORF, UTRs). Most genes containing
                 exon-overrepresented TNRs are associated with gene

                 tracts associate with the same transcription-related GO

  abstract    = "The cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide has long been known to
                 be a hotspot for pathological mutation in the human genome.
                 This hypermutability is related to its role as the major site
                 of cytosine methylation with the attendant risk of spontaneous
                 deamination of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to yield thymine.
                 Cytosine methylation, however, also occurs in the context of
                 CpNpG sites in the human genome, an unsurprising finding since
                 the intrinsic symmetry of CpNpG renders it capable of
                 supporting a semi-conservative model of replication of the
                 methylation pattern. Recently, it has become clear that
                 significant DNA methylation occurs in a CpHpG context (where H
                 = A, C or T) in a variety of human somatic tissues. If we
                 assume that CpHpG methylation also occurs in the germline, and
                 that 5mC deamination can occur within a CpHpG context, then we
                 might surmise that methylated CpHpG sites could also
                 constitute mutation hotspots causing human genetic disease. To
                 test this postulate, 54,625 missense and nonsense mutations
                 from 2,113 genes causing inherited disease were retrieved from
                 the Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.org). Some
                 18.2 per cent of these pathological lesions were found to be C
                 → T and G → A transitions located in CpG dinucleotides
                 (compatible with a model of methylation-mediated deamination
                 of 5mC), an approximately ten-fold higher proportion than
                 would have been expected by chance alone. The corresponding
                 proportion for the CpHpG trinucleotide was 9.9 per cent, an
                 approximately two-fold higher proportion than would have been
                 expected by chance. We therefore estimate that ∼5 per cent of
                 missense/nonsense mutations causing human inherited disease
                 may be attributable to methylation-mediated deamination of 5mC

                 large pool of potential consensus sites. We hypothesized that
                 chromatin may play a significant role in this site-selection
                 process. To test this, we used a custom DNA microarray to
                 measure p53 binding at approximately 2000 sites predicted to
                 possess high-sequence specificity, and identified both
                 strongly bound and weakly bound sites. When placed within a
                 plasmid, weakly bound sites become p53 responsive and regain
                 p53 binding when stably integrated into random genomic
                 locations. Notably, strongly bound sites reside preferentially
                 within genomic regions whose DNA sequence is predicted to
                 encode relatively high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. Using
                 in vivo nucleosome occupancy measurements under conditions
                 where p53 is inactive, we experimentally confirmed this
                 prediction. Furthermore, upon p53 activation, nucleosomes are
                 partially displaced from a relatively broad region surrounding
                 the bound p53 sites, and this displacement is rapidly reversed
                 upon inactivation of p53. Thus, in contrast to the general
                 assumption that transcription-factor binding is preferred in
                 sites that have low nucleosome occupancy prior to factor
                 activation, we find that p53 binding occurs preferentially

                 of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these
                 machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK),
                 a structured programming framework designed to ease the
                 development of efficient and robust analysis tools for
                 next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional
                 programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small
                 but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the
                 majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis
                 calculations from common data management infrastructure
                 enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness,
                 stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable
                 distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight
                 the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation
                 and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage
                 calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling.
                 We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables
                 developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient
                 and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been
                 incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the

                 Sequencing of cancer exomes or transcriptomes or even entire
                 cancer genomes are now possible, though technical and economic
                 challenges remain. Cancer samples are inherently heterogeneous
                 and are often contaminated with normal DNA, placing additional
                 demands on informatics tools for detecting genetic variation.
                 However, even low coverage sequencing data can provide
                 valuable information on genetic rearrangements, amplifications
                 and losses in tumor genomes. Novel recurrent oncogenic
                 mutations and fusion transcripts have been discovered with
                 these technologies. In some sequenced cancer genomes, tens of
                 thousands of genetic alterations have been discovered. While
                 this enables the detailed dissection of mutation classes, it

                 also be completely harmless. Understanding what determines the
                 phenotypical impact is important both for planning targeted
                 mutation experiments in the laboratory and for analyzing
                 naturally occurring mutations found in patients. Common wisdom
                 suggests using the extent of evolutionary conservation of a
                 residue or a sequence motif as an indicator of its functional
                 importance and thus vulnerability in case of mutation. In this
                 work, we put forward the hypothesis that in addition to
                 conservation, co-evolution of residues in a protein influences
                 the likelihood of a residue to be functionally important and
                 thus associated with disease. While the basic idea of a
                 relation between co-evolution and functional sites has been
                 explored before, we have conducted the first systematic and
                 comprehensive analysis of point mutations causing disease in
                 humans with respect to correlated mutations. We included
                 14,211 distinct positions with known disease-causing point
                 mutations in 1,153 human proteins in our analysis. Our data
                 show that (1) correlated positions are significantly more
                 likely to be disease-associated than expected by chance, and
                 that (2) this signal cannot be explained by conservation
                 patterns of individual sequence positions. Although correlated
                 residues have primarily been used to predict contact sites,
                 our data are in agreement with previous observations that (3)
                 many such correlations do not relate to physical contacts

                 patterns. We tested whether these differences reflect
                 selection or are instead a byproduct of germline
                 transcription, using publicly available gene expression data
                 from a variety of germline and somatic tissues. Crossover rate
                 shows a strong negative correlation with gene expression in
                 meiotic tissues, suggesting that crossover is inhibited by
                 transcription. Strand-biased composition (G+T content) and A

                 challenge. In the current study, we provide a mathematical
                 model that begins to address this challenge. We model tumors
                 as a discrete time branching process that starts with a single
                 driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver mutation leads
                 to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Using the
                 model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor
                 development-providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in
                 tumor sizes and development times that have been observed by
                 epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the model
                 provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations

                 Finally, when applied to recent experimental data, the model

                 accurate and efficient, primarily because of two DNA
                 polymerases (Pols): Pols $\delta$ and $\epsilon$. The high
                 fidelity of these enzymes is due to their intrinsic base
                 selectivity and proofreading exonuclease activity which, when
                 coupled with post-replication mismatch repair, helps to
                 maintain human mutation rates at less than one mutation per
                 genome duplication. Conditions that reduce polymerase fidelity
                 result in increased mutagenesis and can lead to cancer in
                 mice. Whereas yeast Pol $\epsilon$ has been well
                 characterized, human Pol $\epsilon$ remains poorly understood.
                 Here, we present the first report on the fidelity of human Pol
                 $\epsilon$. We find that human Pol $\epsilon$ carries out DNA
                 synthesis with high fidelity, even in the absence of its 3'→5'
                 exonucleolytic proofreading and is significantly more accurate

                 similar to that of yeast Pol $\epsilon$, there are several
                 notable exceptions. These include a preference of the human
                 enzyme for T→A over A→T transversions. As compared with other
                 replicative DNA polymerases, human Pol $\epsilon$ is
                 particularly accurate when copying homonucleotide runs of 4-5
                 bases. The base pair substitution specificity and high
                 fidelity for frameshift errors observed for human Pol

                 physical characteristics of a DNA context could have a
                 modulating effect on its mutability, adjusting the impact of
                 damage or the efficiency of repair. Here, we report a

                 heterogeneity has important implications for identifying
                 functional genomic sequences. Outside of gene regions, the
                 origins of rate heterogeneity remain unclear. Experimental
                 studies establish that chromatin compaction affects rates of
                 both DNA lesion formation and repair. A functional association
                 between chromatin status and 5-methyl-cytosine also exists.
                 These suggest that both the total rate and the type of
                 substitution will be affected by chromatin status. Regular
                 positioning of nucleosomes, the building block of chromatin,
                 further predicts that substitution rate and type should vary
                 spatially in an oscillating manner. We addressed chromatin's
                 influence on substitution rate and type in primates. Matched
                 numbers of sites were sampled from Dnase I hypersensitive
                 (DHS) and closed chromatin control flank (Flank). Likelihood
                 ratio tests revealed significant excesses of total and of
                 transition substitutions in Flank compared with matched DHS
                 for both intergenic and intronic samples. An additional excess
                 of CpG transitions was evident for the intergenic, but not
                 intronic, regions. Fluctuation in substitution rate along
                 approximately 1,800 primate promoters was measured using
                 phylogenetic footprinting. Significant positive correlations
                 were evident between the substitution rate and a nucleosome
                 score from resting human T-cells, with up to approximately
                 50\% of the variance in substitution rate accounted for. Using
                 signal processing techniques, a dominant oscillation at
                 approximately 200 bp was evident in both the substitution rate
                 and the nucleosome score. Our results support a role for

                 susceptibility loci, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint
                 the causal variants in subsequent fine-mapping studies. A
                 conventional fine-mapping effort starts by sequencing dozens
                 of randomly selected samples at susceptibility loci to
                 discover candidate variants, which are then placed on custom
                 arrays or used in imputation algorithms to find the causal
                 variants. We propose that one or several rare or low-frequency
                 causal variants can hitchhike the same common tag SNP, so
                 causal variants may not be easily unveiled by conventional
                 efforts. Here, we first demonstrate that the true effect size
                 and proportion of variance explained by a collection of rare
                 causal variants can be underestimated by a common tag SNP,
                 thereby accounting for some of the ``missing heritability'' in
                 GWAS. We then describe a case-selection approach based on
                 phasing long-range haplotypes and sequencing cases predicted
                 to harbor causal variants. We compare this approach with
                 conventional strategies on a simulated data set, and we
                 demonstrate its advantages when multiple causal variants are
                 present. We also evaluate this approach in a GWAS on hearing
                 loss, where the most common causal variant has a minor allele
                 frequency (MAF) of 1.3\% in the general population and 8.2\%
                 in 329 cases. With our case-selection approach, it is present
                 in 88\% of the 32 selected cases (MAF = 66\%), so sequencing a
                 subset of these cases can readily reveal the causal allele.
                 Our results suggest that thinking beyond common variants is

                 maintaining the integrity of genetic information, the factors
                 that affect the neutral mutation rate are of considerable
                 interest. Mammals exhibit two dramatically different neutral
                 mutation rates: the CpG mutation rate, wherein the C of most
                 CpGs (i.e., methyl-CpG) mutate at 10-50 times that of C in any
                 other context or of any other base. The latter mutations
                 constitute the non-CpG rate. The high CpG rate results from
                 the spontaneous deamination of methyl-C to T and incomplete
                 restoration of the ensuing T:G mismatches to C:Gs. Here, we

                 regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes
                 Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases
                 from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set
                 conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also

                 be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the
                 causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min
                 to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform
                 variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it

                 should allow us to further our understanding of the underlying
                 disease-associated mechanisms. Here, we use complex networks
                 to study the role of an amino acid in both local and global
                 structures and determine the extent to which
                 disease-associated and polymorphic SAPs differ in terms of
                 their interactions to other residues.RESULTS:We found that
                 SAPs can be well characterized by network topological
                 features. Mutations are probably disease-associated when they
                 occur at a site with a high centrality value and/or high
                 degree value in a protein structure network. We also
                 discovered that study of the neighboring residues around a
                 mutation site can help to determine whether the mutation is
                 disease-related or not. We compiled a dataset from the
                 Swiss-Prot variant pages and constructed a model to predict
                 disease-associated SAPs based on the random forest algorithm.
                 The values of total accuracy and MCC were 83.0\% and 0.64,
                 respectively, as determined by 5-fold cross-validation. With

                 80.8\% and MCC of 0.59, respectively.CONCLUSIONS:The
                 satisfactory performance suggests that network topological
                 features can be used as quantification measures to determine
                 the importance of a site on a protein, and this approach can
                 complement existing methods for prediction of
                 disease-associated SAPs. Moreover, the use of this method in

                 than 2,000 trait-SNP associations, and the number continues to
                 increase. GWAS have focused on traits with potential
                 consequences for human fitness, including many immunological,
                 metabolic, cardiovascular, and behavioral phenotypes. Given
                 the polygenic nature of complex traits, selection may exert
                 its influence on them by altering allele frequencies at many
                 associated loci, a possibility which has yet to be explored
                 empirically. Here we use 38 different measures of allele
                 frequency variation and 8 iHS scores to characterize over
                 1,300 GWAS SNPs in 53 globally distributed human populations.
                 We apply these same techniques to evaluate SNPs grouped by
                 trait association. We find that groups of SNPs associated with
                 pigmentation, blood pressure, infectious disease, and
                 autoimmune disease traits exhibit unusual allele frequency
                 patterns and elevated iHS scores in certain geographical
                 locations. We also find that GWAS SNPs have generally elevated
                 scores for measures of allele frequency variation and for iHS
                 in Eurasia and East Asia. Overall, we believe that our results
                 provide evidence for selection on several complex traits that
                 has caused changes in allele frequencies and/or elevated iHS
                 scores at a number of associated loci. Since GWAS SNPs
                 collectively exhibit elevated allele frequency measures and
                 iHS scores, selection on complex traits may be quite
                 widespread. Our findings are most consistent with this
                 selection being either positive or negative, although the
                 relative contributions of the two are difficult to discern.
                 Our results also suggest that trait-SNP associations
                 identified in Eurasian samples may not be present in Africa,
                 Oceania, and the Americas, possibly due to differences in
                 linkage disequilibrium patterns. This observation suggests
                 that non-Eurasian and non-East Asian sample populations should
                 be included in future GWAS.",

                 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with human
                 disease. Recently, many researchers applying this strategy
                 have detected strong associations to disease with SNP markers
                 that are either not in linkage disequilibrium with any
                 nonsynonymous SNP or large distances from any annotated gene.
                 In such cases, no well-established standard practice for
                 effective SNP selection for follow-up studies exists. We aim
                 to identify and prioritize groups of SNPs that are more likely
                 to affect phenotypes in order to facilitate efficient SNP
                 selection for follow-up studies.RESULTS:Based on the
                 annotations available in the Ensembl database, we categorized
                 SNPs in the human genome into classes related to regulatory
                 attributes, such as epigenetic modifications and transcription
                 factor binding sites, in addition to classes related to gene
                 structure and cross-species conservation. Using the
                 distribution of derived allele frequencies (DAF) within each
                 class, we assessed the strength of natural selection for each
                 class relative to the genome as a whole. We applied this DAF
                 analysis to Perlegen resequenced SNPs genome-wide. Regulatory

                 complex and difficult to characterize. For example in tumors,
                 immune gene expression is detected from the combination of
                 normal, tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
                 Profiling the immune component of tumors may facilitate the
                 characterization of the poorly understood roles immunity plays
                 in cancer progression. However, the current approaches to
                 analyze the immune component of a tumor rely on incomplete
                 identification of immune factors.METHODS:To facilitate a more
                 comprehensive approach, we created a ranked immunological
                 relevance score for all human genes, developed using a novel
                 strategy that combines text mining and information theory. We
                 used this score to assign an immunological grade to gene
                 expression profiles, and thereby quantify the immunological
                 component of tumors. This immunological relevance score was
                 benchmarked against existing manually curated immune resources
                 as well as high-throughput studies. To further characterize
                 immunological relevance for genes, the relevance score was
                 charted against both the human interactome and cancer
                 information, forming an expanded interactome landscape of
                 tumor immunity. We applied this approach to expression
                 profiles in melanomas, thus identifying and grading their
                 immunological components, followed by identification of their
                 associated protein interactions.RESULTS:The power of this
                 strategy was demonstrated by the observation of early
                 activation of the adaptive immune response and the diversity
                 of the immune component during melanoma progression.
                 Furthermore, the genome-wide immunological relevance score
                 classified melanoma patient groups, whose immunological grade
                 correlated with clinical features, such as immune phenotypes
                 and survival.CONCLUSIONS:The assignment of a ranked
                 immunological relevance score to all human genes extends the
                 content of existing immune gene resources and enriches our
                 understanding of immune involvement in complex biological

                 chromosomal architecture by limiting the possibilities in
                 which genes can be arranged and distributed across the genome.
                 As a direct consequence of this fact it is therefore
                 presumable that diseases such as cancer, harboring DNA copy
                 number alterations (CNAs), will have a symptomatology strongly
                 dependent on modules of functionally-related genes rather than
                 on a unique ``important'' gene.METHODS:We carried out a
                 systematic analysis of more than 140,000 observations of CNAs
                 in cancers and searched by enrichments in gene functional

                 demonstrates the existence of a significant pattern of loss of

                 to unravel the mechanisms that induce variation in the germ
                 line mutation rate and in the genome-wide mutation profile.
                 The rate of germ line mutation is considerably higher for
                 cytosines at CpG sites than for any other nucleotide in the
                 human genome, an increase commonly attributed to cytosine
                 methylation at CpG sites. The CpG mutation rate, however, is
                 not uniform across the genome and, as methylation levels have
                 recently been shown to vary throughout the genome, it has been
                 hypothesized that methylation status may govern variation in
                 the rate of CpG mutation.RESULTS:Here, we use genome-wide
                 methylation data from human sperm cells to investigate the
                 impact of DNA methylation on the CpG substitution rate in
                 introns of human genes. We find that there is a significant
                 correlation between the extent of methylation and the
                 substitution rate at CpG sites. Further, we show that the CpG
                 substitution rate is positively correlated with non-CpG
                 divergence, suggesting susceptibility to factors responsible
                 for the general mutation rate in the genome, and negatively
                 correlated with GC content. We only observe a minor
                 contribution of gene expression level, while recombination

                 methylation contributes to substitution rate variation at CpG

                 networks. Clearly, single nucleotide mutations arising within
                 genomic DNA can lead to the creation of TFBSs. Are molecular
                 processes inducing single nucleotide mutations contributing
                 equally to the creation of TFBSs? In the human genome, a
                 spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine in the context
                 of CpG dinucleotides results in the creation of thymine (C →
                 T), and this mutation has the highest rate among all base
                 substitutions. CpG deamination has been ascribed a role in
                 silencing of transposons and induction of variation in
                 regional methylation. We have previously shown that CpG
                 deamination created thousands of p53-binding sites within
                 genomic sequences of Alu transposons. Interestingly, we have
                 defined a ∼30 bp region in Alu sequence, which, depending on a
                 pattern of CpG deamination, can be converted to functional
                 p53-, PAX-6-, and Myc-binding sites. Here, we have studied
                 single nucleotide mutational events leading to creation of
                 TFBSs in promoters of human genes and in genomic regions bound
                 by such key transcription factors as Oct4, NANOG, and c-Myc.
                 We document that CpG deamination events can create TFBSs with
                 much higher efficiency than other types of mutational events.
                 Our findings add a new role to CpG methylation: We propose
                 that deamination of methylated CpGs constitutes one of the

                 mutations in CpG (CG) dinucleotides. The molecular mechanisms
                 underlying this bias are important factors in human genome
                 evolution and cancer development. The discovery of other
                 nucleotide contexts that have profound effects on substitution
                 rates can improve our understanding of how mutations are
                 acquired, and why mutation hotspots exist.RESULTS:We compared
                 rates of inherited mutations in 1-4 bp nucleotide contexts
                 using reconstructed ancestral states of human single
                 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from intergenic regions. Chimp

                 these variants.METHODS:From the database of genome-wide
                 association studies (GWAS), we selected 36 cardiovascular
                 phenotypes including coronary heart disease, hypertension, and
                 stroke, as well as related quantitative traits (eg, body mass
                 index and plasma lipid levels). We identified 292 SNPs in 270
                 genes associated with a disease or trait at P < 5 \texttimes{}
                 10⁻⁸. As part of the Human Genome-Diversity Project (HGDP),
                 158 (54.1\%) of these SNPs have been genotyped in 938
                 individuals belonging to 52 populations from seven geographic
                 areas. A measure of population differentiation, F(ST), was
                 calculated to quantify differences in risk allele frequencies
                 (RAFs) among populations and geographic areas.RESULTS:Large
                 differences in RAFs were noted in populations of Africa, East
                 Asia, America and Oceania, when compared with other geographic
                 regions. The mean global F(ST) (0.1042) for 158 SNPs among the
                 populations was not significantly higher than the mean global
                 F(ST) of 158 autosomal SNPs randomly sampled from the HGDP
                 database. Significantly higher global F(ST) (P < 0.05) was
                 noted in eight SNPs, based on an empirical distribution of
                 global F(ST) of 2036 putatively neutral SNPs. For four of
                 these SNPs, additional evidence of selection was noted based

                 in RAFs for a set of common SNPs that influence risk of
                 cardiovascular disease were noted between the major world
                 populations. Pairwise comparisons revealed RAF differences for
                 at least eight SNPs that might be due to population-specific

                 study (nuclear lamina binding sites, methylated non-CpG sites
                 and nucleosome-free regions). Strong non-linear relationships
                 are also detected among genomic features near the centromeres
                 of large chromosomes. Microsatellite mutability co-varies with
                 other mutation rates at finer scales, but not at 1 Mb, and
                 shows varying degrees of association with genomic features at
                 different scales.CONCLUSIONS:Our results allow us to speculate
                 about the role of different molecular mechanisms, such as
                 replication, recombination, repair and local chromatin

                 of cryptic, site-specific rate variation on the basis of
                 coincident polymorphisms-sites that are segregating in both

                 longer evolutionary timescale by identifying sites of
                 coincident substitutions using four species. From these data,
                 we develop analytic theory to infer the variance and skewness
                 of the distribution of mutation rates. Even excluding CpG
                 dinucleotides, we find a relatively large coefficient of
                 variation and positive skew, which suggests that, although
                 most sites in the genome have mutation rates near the mean,
                 the distribution contains a long right-hand tail with a small

                 inter-individual variation in methylation profiles. Here we
                 measured methylation levels at 22,290 CpG dinucleotides in
                 lymphoblastoid cell lines from 77 HapMap Yoruba individuals,
                 for which genome-wide gene expression and genotype data were
                 also available. RESULTS: Association analyses of methylation
                 levels with more than three million common single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 180 CpG-sites in 173 genes
                 that were associated with nearby SNPs (putatively in cis,
                 usually within 5 kb) at a false discovery rate of 10\%. The
                 most intriguing trans signal was obtained for SNP rs10876043
                 in the disco-interacting protein 2 homolog B gene (DIP2B,
                 previously postulated to play a role in DNA methylation), that
                 had a genome-wide significant association with the first
                 principal component of patterns of methylation; however, we
                 found only modest signal of trans-acting associations overall.
                 As expected, we found significant negative correlations
                 between promoter methylation and gene expression levels
                 measured by RNA-sequencing across genes. Finally, there was a
                 significant overlap of SNPs that were associated with both
                 methylation and gene expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our
                 results demonstrate a strong genetic component to
                 inter-individual variation in DNA methylation profiles.
                 Furthermore, there was an enrichment of SNPs that affect both

                 present at high frequencies in human populations. Several
                 nonexclusive hypotheses have been proposed to account for this
                 apparent paradox (high new mutation rate, genetic drift,
                 overdominance, or recent changes in selective pressure).
                 However, the factors ultimately responsible for the presence
                 at high frequency of disease-causing mutations are still
                 contentious. Here we establish the existence of an additional
                 process that contributes to the spreading of deleterious
                 mutations: GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a process
                 associated with recombination that tends to favor the

                 detrimental to protein structure and function, and those
                 implicated in human genetic disease. We present simulations to

                 on the human genome and a group of hereditary diseases among

                 conceivable that such ``unclonable'' diseases are not linked
                 to abnormalities of protein coding genes (PCGs), but of
                 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We developed a novel approach termed
                 OMiR (OMIM and miRNAs), to test whether microRNAs (miRNAs)
                 exhibit any associations with mapped genetic diseases not yet

                 diseases for several years. According to the originally stated
                 hypothesis, one or a few common genetic variants with a large
                 effect size control the risk of common diseases. A growing
                 body of evidence, however, suggests that rare
                 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e. those with a
                 minor allele frequency of less than 5\%, are also an important
                 component of the genetic architecture of common human
                 diseases. In this study, we analyzed the relevance of rare
                 SNPs to the risk of common diseases from an evolutionary
                 perspective and found that rare SNPs are more likely than
                 common SNPs to be functional and tend to have a stronger

                 human genetic variation due to the hypermutability of
                 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC). We exploit this hypermutability and a
                 novel codon substitution model to identify candidate
                 functionally important exonic nucleotides. Population genetic
                 theory suggests that codon positions with high cross-species
                 CpG frequency will derive from stronger purifying selection.
                 Using the phylogeny-based maximum likelihood inference
                 framework, we applied codon substitution models with
                 context-dependent parameters to measure the mutagenic and
                 selective processes affecting CpG dinucleotides within exonic
                 sequence. The suitability of these models was validated on >
                 2000 protein coding genes from a naturally occurring
                 biological control, 4 yeast species that do not methylate

                 analyses of > 12000 protein coding genes from 4 primate
                 lineages confirm the systemic influence of 5mC hypermutability
                 on the divergence of these genes. After adjusting for
                 confounding influences of mutation and the properties of the
                 encoded amino acids, we confirmed that CpG-containing codons
                 are under greater purifying selection in primates. Genes with
                 significant evidence of enhanced suppression of nonsynonymous
                 CpG changes were also shown to be significantly enriched in
                 OMIM. We developed a method for ranking candidate
                 phenotypically influential CpG positions in human genes.
                 Application of this method indicates that of the ∼ 1 million

                 nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates, and dS, the
                 synonymous substitution rate has recently been reported. This
                 correlation is unexpected under simple evolutionary models.
                 Here, we investigate two explanations for this correlation:
                 first, whether it is a consequence of a statistical bias in
                 the estimation of $\omega$ and second, whether it is due to
                 substitutions at adjacent sites. Using simulations, we show
                 that estimates of $\omega$ are biased when levels of
                 divergence are low. This is true using the methods of Yang and
                 Nielsen, Nei and Gojobori, and Muse and Gaut. Although the
                 bias could generate a positive correlation between $\omega$
                 and dS, we show that it is unlikely to be the main
                 determinant. Instead we show that the correlation is reduced
                 when genes that are high quality in sequence, annotation, and
                 alignment are used. The remaining--likely genuine--positive
                 correlation appears to be due to adjacent tandem
                 substitutions; single substitutions, though far more numerous,
                 do not contribute to the correlation. Genuine adjacent

                 underlying most eQTLs remain elusive. Here, we use deep mRNA
                 sequencing of two CEU individuals to investigate those
                 mechanisms, with particular focus on the role of splicing
                 control loci (sQTLs). We identify a large number of genes that
                 are differentially spliced between the two samples and
                 associate many of those differences with nearby single
                 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Subsequently, we investigate
                 the potential effect of splicing SNPs on eQTL control in
                 general. We find a significant enrichment of alternative
                 splicing (AS) events within a set of highly confident eQTL

                 most of the genome packaged by protamines not nucleosomes.
                 Nucleosomes are, however, retained at some genomic sites,
                 where they have the potential to transmit paternal epigenetic
                 information. It is not understood how this retention is
                 specified. Here we show that base composition is the major
                 determinant of nucleosome retention in human sperm, predicting
                 retention very well in both genic and non-genic regions of the
                 genome. The retention of nucleosomes at GC-rich sequences with
                 high intrinsic nucleosome affinity accounts for the previously
                 reported retention at transcription start sites and at genes
                 that regulate development. It also means that nucleosomes are
                 retained at the start sites of most housekeeping genes. We
                 also report a striking link between the retention of
                 nucleosomes in sperm and the establishment of DNA
                 methylation-free regions in the early embryo. Taken together,
                 this suggests that paternal nucleosome transmission may
                 facilitate robust gene regulation in the early embryo. We
                 propose that chromatin organization in the male germline,
                 rather than in somatic cells, is the major functional
                 consequence of fine-scale base composition variation in the

                 the complete genome, including both coding and noncoding

                 that variants are functional based on their genomic locations
                 and then use whole-genome sequence data from 29 subjects of
                 European origin to assess the relationship between the
                 functional properties of variants and their population allele

                 catalogs of missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the

                 various methods and their related computational tools to
                 classify these missense SNVs as probably deleterious or
                 probably neutral polymorphisms. The outputs produced by each
                 of these computational tools are of different natures and thus
                 difficult to compare and integrate. Taking advantage of the
                 possible complementarity between different tools might allow

                 each individual method in the task of classifying missense
                 SNVs as deleterious or neutral. Furthermore, we demonstrate
                 that this WAS can be used not only for classification purposes
                 (deleterious versus neutral mutation) but also as an indicator
                 of the impact of the mutation on the functionality of the

  abstract    = "'Nonstop' mutations are single base-pair substitutions that
                 occur within translational termination (stop) codons and which
                 can lead to the continued and inappropriate translation of the
                 mRNA into the 3'-untranslated region. We have performed a
                 meta-analysis of the 119 nonstop mutations (in 87 different
                 genes) known to cause human inherited disease, examining the
                 sequence context of the mutated stop codons and the average
                 distance to the next alternative in-frame stop codon
                 downstream, in comparison with their counterparts from control
                 (non-mutated) gene sequences. A paucity of alternative
                 in-frame stop codons was noted in the immediate vicinity (0-49
                 nucleotides downstream) of the mutated stop codons as compared
                 with their control counterparts (p = 7.81 \texttimes{} 10-4).
                 This implies that at least some nonstop mutations with
                 alternative stop codons in close proximity will not have come
                 to clinical attention, possibly because they will have given
                 rise to stable mRNAs (not subject to nonstop mRNA decay) that
                 are translatable into proteins of near-normal length and
                 biological function. A significant excess of downstream
                 in-frame stop codons was, however, noted in the range 150-199
                 nucleotides from the mutated stop codon (p = 8.55 \texttimes{}
                 10-4). We speculate that recruitment of an alternative stop
                 codon at greater distance from the mutated stop codon may
                 trigger nonstop mRNA decay, thereby decreasing the amount of
                 protein product and yielding a readily discernible clinical
                 phenotype. Confirmation or otherwise of this postulate must
                 await the emergence of a clearer understanding of the
                 mechanism of nonstop mRNA decay in mammalian cells.",

              sets from human and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), we found
              an enrichment of positioned nucleosome on pre-miRNA genomic
              sequences, which is highly correlated with GC content within
              pre-miRNA. In addition, obvious enrichments of three histone
              modifications (H2BK5me1, H3K36me3 and H4K20me1) as well as RNA
              Polymerase II (RNAPII) were observed on pre-miRNA genomic
              sequences corresponding to the active-promoter miRNAs and
              expressed miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed the chromatin
              structure characteristics of pre-miRNA genomic sequences, and
              implied potential mechanisms that can recognize these
              characteristics, thus improving pre-miRNA cleavage.",

                 between the two DNA strands. In the human genome, nucleotide
                 substitutions occur at different rates on the transcribed and
                 non-transcribed strands that may result from
                 transcription-coupled repair. These mutational asymmetries
                 generate transcription-associated compositional skews. To
                 date, the existence of such asymmetries associated with
                 replication has not yet been established. Here, we compute the
                 nucleotide substitution matrices around replication initiation
                 zones identified as sharp peaks in replication timing profiles
                 and associated with abrupt jumps in the compositional skew
                 profile. We show that the substitution matrices computed in
                 these regions fully explain the jumps in the compositional
                 skew profile when crossing initiation zones. In intergenic
                 regions, we observe mutational asymmetries measured as
                 differences between complementary substitution rates; their
                 sign changes when crossing initiation zones. These mutational
                 asymmetries are unlikely to result from cryptic transcription
                 but can be explained by a model based on replication errors
                 and strand-biased repair. In transcribed regions, mutational
                 asymmetries associated with replication superimpose on the
                 previously described mutational asymmetries associated with
                 transcription. We separate the substitution asymmetries
                 associated with both mechanisms, which allows us to determine
                 for the first time in eukaryotes, the mutational asymmetries
                 associated with replication and to reevaluate those associated
                 with transcription. Replication-associated mutational
                 asymmetry may result from unequal rates of complementary base
                 misincorporation by the DNA polymerases coupled with DNA
                 mismatch repair (MMR) acting with different efficiencies on
                 the leading and lagging strands. Replication, acting in germ
                 line cells during long evolutionary times, contributed equally
                 with transcription to produce the present abrupt jumps in the
                 compositional skew. These results demonstrate that DNA

                 Among the analysis steps, functional prediction (of being
                 deleterious) plays an important role in filtering or
                 prioritizing nonsynonymous SNP (NS) for further analysis.
                 Unfortunately, different prediction algorithms use different
                 information and each has its own strength and weakness. It has
                 been suggested that investigators should use predictions from
                 multiple algorithms instead of relying on a single one.
                 However, querying predictions from different
                 databases/Web-servers for different algorithms is both tedious

                 deep sequencing successfully spliced transcripts. All 4096
                 6-mers were substituted at five positions within two different
                 internal exons in a 3-exon minigene, and millions of
                 successfully spliced transcripts were sequenced after
                 transfection of human cells. The results allowed the
                 assignment of a relative splicing strength score to each
                 mutant molecule. The effect of 6-mers on splicing often
                 depended on their location; much of this context effect could
                 be ascribed to the creation of different overlapping sequences
                 at each site. Taking these overlaps into account, the splicing
                 effect of each 6-mer could be quantified, and 6-mers could be
                 designated as enhancers (ESEseqs) and silencers (ESSseqs),
                 with an ESRseq score indicating their strength. Some 6-mers
                 exhibited positional bias relative to the two splice sites.
                 The distribution and conservation of these ESRseqs in and
                 around human exons supported their classification. Predicted
                 RNA secondary structure effects were also seen: Effective
                 enhancers, silencers and 3' splice sites tend to be single
                 stranded, and effective 5' splice sites tend to be double
                 stranded. 6-mers that may form positive or negative synergy
                 with another were also identified. Chromatin structure may
                 also influence the splicing enhancement observed, as a good
                 correspondence was found between splicing performance and the
                 predicted nucleosome occupancy scores of 6-mers. This approach
                 may prove of general use in defining nucleic acid regulatory
                 motifs, substitute for functional SELEX in most cases, and

  abstract    = "In the human genome, it has been estimated that considerably
                 more sequence is under natural selection in non-coding regions
                 [such as transcription-factor binding sites (TF-binding sites)
                 and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)] compared to protein-coding ones.
                 However, less attention has been paid to them. To study
                 selective pressure on non-coding elements, we use
                 next-generation sequencing data from the recently completed
                 pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes Project, which, compared to
                 traditional methods, allows for the characterization of a full
                 spectrum of genomic variations, including single-nucleotide
                 polymorphisms (SNPs), short insertions and deletions (indels)
                 and structural variations (SVs). We develop a framework for
                 combining these variation data with non-coding elements,
                 calculating various population-based metrics to compare
                 classes and subclasses of elements, and developing
                 element-aware aggregation procedures to probe the internal
                 structure of an element. Overall, we find that TF-binding
                 sites and ncRNAs are less selectively constrained for SNPs
                 than coding sequences (CDSs), but more constrained than a
                 neutral reference. We also determine that the relative amounts
                 of constraint for the three types of variations are, in
                 general, correlated, but there are some differences:
                 counter-intuitively, TF-binding sites and ncRNAs are more
                 selectively constrained for indels than for SNPs, compared to
                 CDSs. After inspecting the overall properties of a class of
                 elements, we analyze selective pressure on subclasses within
                 an element class, and show that the extent of selection is
                 associated with the genomic properties of each subclass. We
                 find, for instance, that ncRNAs with higher expression levels
                 tend to be under stronger purifying selection, and the actual
                 regions of TF-binding motifs are under stronger selective
                 pressure than the corresponding peak regions. Further, we
                 develop element-aware aggregation plots to analyze selective
                 pressure across the linear structure of an element, with the
                 confidence intervals evaluated using both simple bootstrapping
                 and block bootstrapping techniques. We find, for example, that
                 both micro-RNAs (particularly the seed regions) and their
                 binding targets are under stronger selective pressure for SNPs
                 than their immediate genomic surroundings. In addition, we
                 demonstrate that substitutions in TF-binding motifs inversely
                 correlate with site conservation, and SNPs unfavorable for
                 motifs are under more selective constraints than favorable
                 SNPs. Finally, to further investigate intra-element
                 differences, we show that SVs have the tendency to use
                 distinctive modes and mechanisms when they interact with
                 genomic elements, such as enveloping whole gene(s) rather than
                 disrupting them partially, as well as duplicating TF motifs in
                 tandem.",

                 However, the impact of nucleosomes on DNA methylation in vitro

                 detailed analysis of nucleosome binding and nucleosomal DNA

                 CpG methylation. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling frees
                 nucleosomal CpG dinucleotides and renders the remodelled
                 nucleosome a 2-fold better substrate for Dnmt3a

                 phenotypic variation, but the discovery of genetic
                 interactions in humans has proved difficult. In this study, we
                 show that the spectrum of variation in the human genome has
                 been shaped by modifier effects of cis-regulatory variation on

                 variants. We analyzed 1000 Genomes population-scale
                 resequencing data from Europe (CEU [Utah residents with
                 Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH
                 collection]) and Africa (YRI [Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria])
                 together with gene expression data from arrays and RNA
                 sequencing for the same samples. We observed an
                 underrepresentation of derived putatively functional coding
                 variation on the more highly expressed regulatory haplotype,
                 which suggests stronger purifying selection against
                 deleterious coding variants that have increased penetrance
                 because of their regulatory background. Furthermore, the
                 frequency spectrum and impact size distribution of common
                 regulatory polymorphisms (eQTLs) appear to be shaped in order
                 to minimize the selective disadvantage of having deleterious
                 coding mutations on the more highly expressed haplotype.
                 Interestingly, eQTLs explaining common disease GWAS signals
                 showed an enrichment of putative epistatic effects, suggesting
                 that some disease associations might arise from interactions
                 increasing the penetrance of rare coding variants. In
                 conclusion, our results indicate that regulatory and coding
                 variants often modify the functional impact of each other.
                 This specific type of genetic interaction is detectable from
                 sequencing data in a genome-wide manner, and characterizing

                 important class of human genetic variation, but are
                 underrepresented in current databases that are based on small
                 population samples. Recent studies show that variants altering
                 amino acid sequence and protein function are enriched at low
                 variant allele frequency, 2 to 5\%, but because of
                 insufficient sample size it is not clear if the same trend
                 holds for rare variants below 1\% allele frequency. RESULTS:
                 The 1000 Genomes Exon Pilot Project has collected
                 deep-coverage exon-capture data in roughly 1,000 human genes,
                 for nearly 700 samples. Although medical whole-exome projects
                 are currently afoot, this is still the deepest reported
                 sampling of a large number of human genes with next-generation
                 technologies. According to the goals of the 1000 Genomes
                 Project, we created effective informatics pipelines to process
                 and analyze the data, and discovered 12,758 exonic SNPs, 70\%
                 of them novel, and 74\% below 1\% allele frequency in the
                 seven population samples we examined. Our analysis confirms
                 that coding variants below 1\% allele frequency show increased
                 population-specificity and are enriched for functional
                 variants. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a large step
                 toward detecting and interpreting low frequency coding
                 variation, clearly lays out technical steps for effective
                 analysis of DNA capture data, and articulates functional and

                 published, along with the genome from a noncancer tissue from
                 the same individual, allowing the identification of new
                 somatic mutations in the cancer. We show that there is
                 significant variation in the density of mutations at the 1-Mb
                 scale within three cancer genomes and that the density of
                 mutations is correlated between them. We also demonstrate that
                 the density of mutations is correlated to that in the
                 germline, as measured by the divergence between humans and
                 chimpanzees and humans and macaques. We show that the density
                 of mutations is correlated to the guanine and cytosine (GC)
                 conent, replication time, distance to telomere and centromere,
                 gene density, and nucleosome occupancy in the cancer genomes.
                 However, overall, all factors explain less than 40\% of the
                 variance in mutation density and each factor explains very
                 little of the variance. We find that genes associated with
                 cancer occupy regions of the genome with significantly lower
                 mutation rates than the average. Finally, we show that the
                 density of mutations varies at a 10-Mb and a chromosomal
                 scale, but that the variation at these scales is weak. Hum

                 chromatin organization and methylation, such relationships can
                 be explored systematically. As well-defined surrogates for
                 heterochromatin, we tested the relationship between DNA
                 replication timing and DNase hypersensitivity with cytosine
                 methylation in two human cell types, unexpectedly finding the
                 later-replicating, more heterochromatic regions to be less
                 methylated than early replicating regions. When we integrated
                 gene-expression data into the study, we found that regions of
                 increased gene expression were earlier replicating, as
                 previously identified, and that transcription-targeted
                 cytosine methylation in gene bodies contributes to the
                 positive correlation with early replication. A self-organizing

                 lineage through the comparison of interspecies and
                 intraspecies rates of divergence. We identify significant
                 evidence for both positive and negative selection linked to
                 human nucleosome positioning for the first time, implicating a
                 widespread and important role for DNA sequence in the location
                 of well-positioned nucleosomes. Selection appears to be acting
                 on particular base substitutions to maintain optimum GC
                 compositions in core and linker regions, with, e.g.,
                 unexpectedly elevated rates of C→T substitutions during recent
                 human evolution at linker regions 60-90 bp from the nucleosome
                 dyad but significant depletion of the same substitutions
                 within nucleosome core regions. These patterns are strikingly
                 consistent with the known relationships between genomic
                 sequence composition and nucleosome assembly. By stratifying
                 nucleosomes according to the GC content of their genomic
                 neighborhood, we also show that the strength and direction of
                 selection detected is dictated by local GC content.
                 Intriguingly these signatures of selection are not restricted
                 to nucleosomes in close proximity to exons, suggesting the
                 correct positioning of nucleosomes is not only important in

                 evidence that the genomic sequences associated with
                 nucleosomes are not evolving neutrally, and suggests that
                 underlying DNA sequence is an important factor in nucleosome
                 positioning. Recent signatures of selection linked to genomic
                 features as ubiquitous as the nucleosome have important

                 been found to be often conditional and dynamic. Many studies
                 have suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
                 have impacts on gene expression variations in human
                 populations. RESULTS: The SNPxGE(2) database contains the
                 computationally predicted human SNP-coexpression associations,
                 i.e. the differential coexpression between 2 genes is
                 associated with the genotypes of an SNP. This data was
                 generated from a large scale association study that was based
                 on the HapMap phase I data, which covered 269 individuals from
                 4 human populations, 556,873 SNPs and 15,000 gene expression
                 profiles. In order to reduce the computational cost, the
                 SNP-coexpression associations were assessed using
                 gap/substitution models, proven to have a comparable power to
                 logistic regression models. The results, at a false discovery
                 rate cutoff of 0.1, consisted of 44,769 and 50,792
                 SNP-coexpression associations based on single and pooled
                 populations respectively, and can be queried in the SNPxGE(2)

                 pilot study to explore the practical challenges of applying
                 high-throughput sequencing in clinical oncology. We enrolled
                 patients with advanced or refractory cancer who were eligible

                 whole-genome sequencing of the tumor, targeted whole-exome
                 sequencing of tumor and normal DNA, and transcriptome
                 sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the tumor to identify potentially
                 informative mutations in a clinically relevant time frame of 3
                 to 4 weeks. With this approach, we detected several classes of
                 cancer mutations including structural rearrangements, copy
                 number alterations, point mutations, and gene expression
                 alterations. A multidisciplinary Sequencing Tumor Board (STB)
                 deliberated on the clinical interpretation of the sequencing
                 results obtained. We tested our sequencing strategy on human
                 prostate cancer xenografts. Next, we enrolled two patients
                 into the clinical protocol and were able to review the results
                 at our STB within 24 days of biopsy. The first patient had
                 metastatic colorectal cancer in which we identified somatic
                 point mutations in NRAS, TP53, AURKA, FAS, and MYH11, plus
                 amplification and overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 8

                 identified a somatic point mutation in HRAS and a structural

                 for roughly three quarters of the total DNA methylation

                 analysis of non-CpG methylation in 76 genome-scale DNA
                 methylation maps across pluripotent and differentiated human
                 cell types. We confirm non-CpG methylation to be predominantly

                 differentiation and near complete absence in various somatic

                 the patterns are highly variable and show little conservation

                 challenges to the aggregate analysis and interpretation of
                 these data in general and to the analysis of trials according

                 these data could enhance the utility of ClinicalTrials.gov as
                 a research resource. METHODS/PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The purpose of
                 our project was twofold. First, we sought to extend the
                 usability of ClinicalTrials.gov for research purposes by
                 developing a database for aggregate analysis of
                 ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) that contains data from the 96,346
                 clinical trials registered as of September 27, 2010. Second,
                 we developed and validated a methodology for annotating
                 studies by clinical specialty, using a custom taxonomy
                 employing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms applied by an
                 NLM algorithm, as well as MeSH terms and other disease
                 condition terms provided by study sponsors. Clinical
                 specialists reviewed and annotated MeSH and non-MeSH disease
                 condition terms, and an algorithm was created to classify
                 studies into clinical specialties based on both MeSH and
                 non-MeSH annotations. False positives and false negatives were
                 evaluated by comparing algorithmic classification with manual
                 classification for three specialties.
                 CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The resulting AACT database features
                 study design attributes parsed into discrete fields,
                 integrated metadata, and an integrated MeSH thesaurus, and is

                 address this, we comprehensively analyzed heritable
                 genome-wide binding patterns of a major sequence-specific
                 regulator (CTCF) in relation to genetic variability in binding
                 site sequences across a multi-generational pedigree. We
                 localized and quantified CTCF occupancy by ChIP-seq in 12
                 related and unrelated individuals spanning three generations,
                 followed by comprehensive targeted resequencing of the entire
                 CTCF-binding landscape across all individuals. We identified
                 hundreds of variants with reproducible quantitative effects on
                 CTCF occupancy (both positive and negative). While these
                 effects paralleled protein-DNA recognition energetics when
                 averaged, they were extensively buffered by striking local
                 context dependencies. In the significant majority of cases
                 buffering was complete, resulting in silent variants spanning
                 every position within the DNA recognition interface
                 irrespective of level of binding energy or evolutionary
                 constraint. The prevalence of complex partial or complete
                 buffering effects severely constrained the ability to predict
                 reliably the impact of variation within any given binding site
                 instance. Surprisingly, 40\% of variants that increased CTCF
                 occupancy occurred at positions of human-chimp divergence,
                 challenging the expectation that the vast majority of
                 functional regulatory variants should be deleterious. Our
                 results suggest that, even in the presence of ``perfect''
                 genetic information afforded by resequencing and parallel
                 studies in multiple related individuals, genomic site-specific
                 prediction of the consequences of individual variation in

                 mutation rate. We estimated the gene-wise mutation rate based
                 on the individual-specific background mutation rate along with
                 the gene length. Taking the mutation rate as a weight for each
                 gene, our weighted resampling strategy builds the null
                 distribution for each pathway while matching the gene length
                 patterns. The empirical P value obtained then provides an
                 adjusted statistical evaluation. PRINCIPAL
                 FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated our weighted resampling
                 method to a lung adenocarcinomas dataset and a glioblastoma
                 dataset, and compared it to other widely applied methods. By
                 explicitly adjusting gene-length, the weighted resampling
                 method performs as well as the standard methods for
                 significant pathways with strong evidence. Importantly, our
                 method could effectively reject many marginally significant
                 pathways detected by standard methods, including several
                 long-gene-based, cancer-unrelated pathways. We further
                 demonstrated that by reducing such biases, pathway crosstalk
                 for each individual and pathway co-mutation map across
                 multiple individuals can be objectively explored and
                 evaluated. This method performs pathway analysis in a
                 sample-centered fashion, and provides an alternative way for
                 accurate analysis of cancer-personalized genomes. It can be
                 extended to other types of genomic data (genotyping and
                 methylation) that have similar bias problems.",

                 alterations affecting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
                 (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and they are
                 strongly associated with response to treatment with tyrosine
                 kinase inhibitors. A series of 116 NSCLC DNA samples
                 investigated by Sanger Sequencing (SS), including 106 samples
                 carrying exon 19 EGFR deletions and 10 without deletions
                 (control samples), were subjected to deep next generation
                 sequencing (NGS). All samples with deletions at SS showed
                 deletions with NGS. No deletions were seen in control cases.
                 In 93 (88\%) cases, deletions detected by NGS were exactly
                 corresponding to those identified by SS. In 13 cases (12\%)
                 NGS resolved deletions not accurately characterized by SS. In
                 21 (20\%) cases the NGS showed presence of complex
                 (double/multiple) frameshift deletions producing a net
                 in-frame change. In 5 of these cases the SS could not define
                 the exact sequence of mutant alleles, in the other 16 cases
                 the results obtained by SS were conventionally considered as
                 deletions plus insertions. Different interpretative hypotheses
                 for complex mutations are discussed. In 46 (43\%) tumors deep
                 NGS showed, for the first time to our knowledge,
                 subpopulations of DNA molecules carrying EGFR deletions
                 different from the main one. Each of these subpopulations
                 accounted for 0.1\% to 17\% of the genomic DNA in the
                 different tumors investigated. Our findings suggest that a
                 region in exon 19 is highly unstable in a large proportion of
                 patients carrying EGFR deletions. As a corollary to this
                 study, NGS data were compared with those obtained by
                 immunohistochemistry using the 6B6 anti-mutant EGFR antibody.

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND:Large-scale tumor sequencing projects are now
                 underway to identify genetic mutations that drive tumor
                 initiation and development. Most studies take a gene-based
                 approach to identifying driver mutations, highlighting genes
                 mutated in a large percentage of tumor samples as those likely
                 to contain driver mutations. However, this gene-based approach
                 usually does not consider the position of the mutation within
                 the gene or the functional context the position of the
                 mutation provides. Here we introduce a novel method for
                 mapping mutations to distinct protein domains, not just
                 individual genes, in which they occur, thus providing the
                 functional context for how the mutation contributes to
                 disease. Furthermore, aggregating mutations from all genes
                 containing a specific protein domain enables the
                 identification of mutations that are rare at the gene level,
                 but that occur frequently within the specified domain. These
                 highly mutated domains potentially reveal disruptions of
                 protein function necessary for cancer development.RESULTS:We
                 mapped somatic mutations from the protein coding regions of
                 100 colon adenocarcinoma tumor samples to the genes and
                 protein domains in which they occurred, and constructed
                 topographical maps to depict the ``mutational landscapes'' of
                 gene and domain mutation frequencies. We found significant
                 mutation frequency in a number of genes previously known to be
                 somatically mutated in colon cancer patients including APC,
                 TP53 and KRAS. In addition, we found significant mutation
                 frequency within specific domains located in these genes, as
                 well as within other domains contained in genes having low
                 mutation frequencies. These domain ``peaks'' were enriched
                 with functions important to cancer development including
                 kinase activity, DNA binding and repair, and signal
                 transduction.CONCLUSIONS:Using our method to create the domain
                 landscapes of mutations in colon cancer, we were able to
                 identify somatic mutations with high potential to drive cancer
                 development. Interestingly, the majority of the genes involved
                 have a low mutation frequency. Therefore, the method shows
                 good potential for identifying rare driver mutations in
                 current, large-scale tumor sequencing projects. In addition,
                 mapping mutations to specific domains provides the necessary
                 functional context for understanding how the mutations
                 contribute to the disease, and may reveal novel or more
                 refined gene and domain target regions for drug development.",

                 dinucleotides, is a dynamic epigenetic regulation mechanism in
                 most eukaryotic genomes. It is already known that methylated
                 CpG dinucleotides can lead to a high rate of C to T mutation
                 at these sites. However, less is known about whether and how
                 the methylation level causes a different mutation rate,
                 especially at the single-base resolution.RESULTS:In this
                 study, we used genome-wide single-base resolution methylation
                 data to perform a comprehensive analysis of the mutation rate
                 of methylated cytosines from human embryonic stem cell.
                 Through the analysis of the density of single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms, we first confirmed that the mutation rate in
                 methylated CpG sites is greater than that in unmethylated CpG
                 sites. Then, we showed that among methylated CpG sites, the
                 mutation rate is markedly increased in low-intermediately
                 (20-40\% methylation level) to intermediately methylated CpG
                 sites (40-60\% methylation level) of the human genome. This
                 mutation pattern was observed regardless of DNA strand
                 direction and the sequence coverage over the site on which the
                 methylation level was calculated. Moreover, this highly
                 non-random mutation pattern was found more apparent in
                 intergenic and intronic regions than in promoter regions and
                 CpG islands. Our investigation suggested this pattern appears
                 primarily in autosomes rather than sex chromosomes. Further
                 analysis based on human-chimpanzee divergence confirmed these
                 observations. Finally, we observed a significant correlation
                 between the methylation level and cytosine allele
                 frequency.CONCLUSIONS:Our results showed a high mutation rate

                 surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to
                 occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that
                 affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same
                 patient. While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in
                 cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is
                 incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have
                 developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer
                 (MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical
                 tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1)
                 Member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor
                 samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to
                 participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration
                 events within the modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to
                 data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the method
                 identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma
                 (GBM) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of
                 genomic alterations in the PI(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In
                 serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel observation that
                 inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is mutually exclusive of

                 genome-wide measurements of somatic mutations in large numbers
                 of cancer patients. A major challenge in the interpretation of
                 these data is to distinguish functional ``driver mutations''
                 important for cancer development from random ``passenger
                 mutations.'' A common approach for identifying driver
                 mutations is to find genes that are mutated at significant
                 frequency in a large cohort of cancer genomes. This approach
                 is confounded by the observation that driver mutations target
                 multiple cellular signaling and regulatory pathways. Thus,
                 each cancer patient may exhibit a different combination of
                 mutations that are sufficient to perturb these pathways. This
                 mutational heterogeneity presents a problem for predicting
                 driver mutations solely from their frequency of occurrence. We
                 introduce two combinatorial properties, coverage and
                 exclusivity, that distinguish driver pathways, or groups of
                 genes containing driver mutations, from groups of genes with
                 passenger mutations. We derive two algorithms, called Dendrix,
                 to find driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data. We
                 apply Dendrix to analyze somatic mutation data from 623 genes
                 in 188 lung adenocarcinoma patients, 601 genes in 84
                 glioblastoma patients, and 238 known mutations in 1000
                 patients with various cancers. In all data sets, we find
                 groups of genes that are mutated in large subsets of patients
                 and whose mutations are approximately exclusive. Our Dendrix
                 algorithms scale to whole-genome analysis of thousands of
                 patients and thus will prove useful for larger data sets to

                 emerged as an important tool for linking genetic variation to
                 changes in gene regulation. However, it remains difficult to
                 identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is
                 known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here
                 we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin
                 accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major
                 mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene
                 expression differences among humans. We used DNase I
                 sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba
                 lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and
                 estimates of gene expression levels are also available. We
                 obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase
                 I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce
                 genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each

                 a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion
                 (false discovery rate = 10\%). We call such variants 'DNase I
                 sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that
                 dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription
                 factor binding sites and are frequently associated with
                 allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A
                 substantial fraction (16\%) of dsQTLs are also associated with
                 variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is,
                 these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we
                 estimate that as many as 55\% of eQTL single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that
                 dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely

                 that depend on results from single tumor-biopsy
                 samples.METHODS:To examine intratumor heterogeneity, we
                 performed exome sequencing, chromosome aberration analysis,
                 and ploidy profiling on multiple spatially separated samples
                 obtained from primary renal carcinomas and associated
                 metastatic sites. We characterized the consequences of
                 intratumor heterogeneity using immunohistochemical analysis,
                 mutation functional analysis, and profiling of messenger RNA
                 expression.RESULTS:Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed
                 branched evolutionary tumor growth, with 63 to 69\% of all
                 somatic mutations not detectable across every tumor region.
                 Intratumor heterogeneity was observed for a mutation within an
                 autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin
                 (mTOR) kinase, correlating with S6 and 4EBP phosphorylation in
                 vivo and constitutive activation of mTOR kinase activity in
                 vitro. Mutational intratumor heterogeneity was seen for
                 multiple tumor-suppressor genes converging on loss of
                 function; SETD2, PTEN, and KDM5C underwent multiple distinct
                 and spatially separated inactivating mutations within a single
                 tumor, suggesting convergent phenotypic evolution.
                 Gene-expression signatures of good and poor prognosis were
                 detected in different regions of the same tumor. Allelic
                 composition and ploidy profiling analysis revealed extensive
                 intratumor heterogeneity, with 26 of 30 tumor samples from
                 four tumors harboring divergent allelic-imbalance profiles and
                 with ploidy heterogeneity in two of four
                 tumors.CONCLUSIONS:Intratumor heterogeneity can lead to

                 different from those of the past and it must adapt
                 accordingly. The size and expense of phase III clinical trials
                 continue to increase, but the success rate remains
                 unacceptably low. Adaptive trial designs can make development
                 more informative, addressing whether a drug is safe and
                 effective while showing how it should be delivered and to
                 whom. An adaptive design is one in which the accumulating data
                 are used to modify the trial's course. Adaptive designs are
                 ideal for addressing many questions at once. For example, a
                 single trial might identify the appropriate patient
                 population, dose and regimen, and therapeutic combinations,
                 and then switch seamlessly into a phase III confirmatory
                 trial. Adaptive designs rely on information, including from
                 patients who have not achieved the trial's primary end point.
                 Longitudinal models of biomarkers (including tumor burden
                 assessed via imaging) enable predictions of primary end
                 points. Taking a Bayesian perspective facilitates building an
                 efficient and accurate trial, including using longitudinal
                 information. A wholly new paradigm for drug development
                 exemplifying personalized medicine is evinced by an adaptive

                 insertion mutations were analysed at the nucleotide level,
                 from the COSMIC database. The most frequent substitutions were
                 c→t, g→a, g→t, and the most frequent codon changes were to
                 termination codons. Deletions more than insertions, FS
                 (frameshift) indels more than I-F (in-frame) ones, and
                 single-nucleotide indels, were frequent. FS indels cause loss
                 of significant fractions of proteins. The 5'-cut in FS
                 deletions, and 5'-ligation in FS insertions, often occur
                 between pairs of identical bases. Interestingly, the cut-site
                 and 3'-ligation in insertions, and 3'-cut and join-pair in
                 deletions, were each found to be the same significantly often
                 (p < 0.001). It is suggested that these features aid the
                 incorporation of indel mutations. Tumor suppressors undergo
                 larger numbers of mutations, especially disruptive ones, over
                 the entire protein length, to inactivate two alleles.
                 Proto-oncogenes undergo fewer, less-disruptive mutations, in
                 selected protein regions, to activate a single allele.

                 interventional clinical trials registered in the
                 ClinicalTrials.gov database.METHODS:A data set comprising
                 96,346 clinical studies from ClinicalTrials.gov was downloaded
                 on September 27, 2010, and entered into a relational database
                 to analyze aggregate data. Interventional trials were
                 identified and analyses were focused on 3 clinical
                 specialties-cardiovascular, mental health, and oncology-that
                 together encompass the largest number of disability-adjusted
                 life-years lost in the United States.MAIN OUTCOME
                 MEASURES:Characteristics of registered clinical trials as
                 reported data elements in the trial registry; how those
                 characteristics have changed over time; differences in
                 characteristics as a function of clinical specialty; and
                 factors associated with use of randomization, blinding, and
                 data monitoring committees (DMCs).RESULTS:The number of
                 registered interventional clinical trials increased from
                 28,881 (October 2004-September 2007) to 40,970 (October
                 2007-September 2010), and the number of missing data elements
                 has generally declined. Most interventional trials registered
                 between 2007 and 2010 were small, with 62\% enrolling 100 or
                 fewer participants. Many clinical trials were single-center
                 (66\%; 24,788/37,520) and funded by organizations other than
                 industry or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (47\%;
                 17,592/37,520). Heterogeneity in the reported methods by
                 clinical specialty; sponsor type; and the reported use of
                 DMCs, randomization, and blinding was evident. For example,
                 reported use of DMCs was less common in industry-sponsored vs
                 NIH-sponsored trials (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.11; 95\% CI,
                 0.09-0.14), earlier-phase vs phase 3 trials (adjusted OR,
                 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.91), and mental health trials vs those
                 in the other 2 specialties. In similar comparisons,
                 randomization and blinding were less frequently reported in
                 earlier-phase, oncology, and device trials.CONCLUSION:Clinical
                 trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov are dominated by small
                 trials and contain significant heterogeneity in methodological
                 approaches, including reported use of randomization, blinding,
                 and DMCs.",

  abstract    = "Chromosomal common fragile sites (CFSs) are unstable genomic
                 regions that break under replication stress and are involved
                 in structural variation. They frequently are sites of
                 chromosomal rearrangements in cancer and of viral integration.
                 However, CFSs are undercharacterized at the molecular level
                 and thus difficult to predict computationally. Newly available
                 genome-wide profiling studies provide us with an unprecedented
                 opportunity to associate CFSs with features of their local
                 genomic contexts. Here, we contrasted the genomic landscape of
                 cytogenetically defined aphidicolin-induced CFSs (aCFSs) to
                 that of nonfragile sites, using multiple logistic regression.
                 We also analyzed aCFS breakage frequencies as a function of
                 their genomic landscape, using standard multiple regression.
                 We show that local genomic features are effective predictors
                 both of regions harboring aCFSs (explaining ∼77\% of the
                 deviance in logistic regression models) and of aCFS breakage
                 frequencies (explaining ∼45\% of the variance in standard
                 regression models). In our optimal models (having highest
                 explanatory power), aCFSs are predominantly located in
                 G-negative chromosomal bands and away from centromeres, are
                 enriched in Alu repeats, and have high DNA flexibility. In
                 alternative models, CpG island density, transcription start
                 site density, H3K4me1 coverage, and mononucleotide
                 microsatellite coverage are significant predictors. Also,
                 aCFSs have high fragility when colocated with evolutionarily
                 conserved chromosomal breakpoints. Our models are predictive
                 of the fragility of aCFSs mapped at a higher resolution.
                 Importantly, the genomic features we identified here as
                 significant predictors of fragility allow us to draw valuable
                 inferences on the molecular mechanisms underlying aCFSs.",

                 thymines, accounting for a large proportion of spontaneous
                 point mutations. The repair system would leave substantial
                 numbers of errors in neighboring regions if the synthesis of
                 erased gaps around deaminated 5-methyl-cytosines is
                 error-prone. Indeed, we identified an unexpected genome-wide
                 role of the CpG methylation state as a major determinant of
                 proximal natural genetic variation. Specifically, 507 Mbp
                 (~18\%) of the human genome was within 10 bp of a CpG site; in
                 these regions, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rate
                 significantly increased by ~50\% (p<10(-566) by two-proportion
                 z-test) if the neighboring CpG sites are methylated. To
                 reconfirm this finding in another vertebrate, we compared six
                 single-base resolution methylomes in two inbred medaka
                 (Oryzias latipes) strains with sufficient genetic divergence
                 (3.4\%). We found that the SNP rate also increased by ~50\%
                 (p<10(-2170)) and the substitution rates in all dinucleotides
                 increased simultaneously (p<10(-441)) around methylated CpG
                 sites. In the hypomethylated regions, the ``CGCG'' motif was
                 significantly enriched (p<10(-680)) and evolutionarily
                 conserved (p=~0.203\%), and slow CpG deamination rather than
                 fast CpG gain was seen, indicating a possible role of CGCG as
                 a candidate cis-element for the hypomethylation state. In
                 regions that were hypermethylated in germline-like tissues but
                 were hypomethylated in somatic liver cells, the SNP rate was
                 significantly smaller than that in hypomethylated regions in
                 both tissues, suggesting a positive selective pressure during
                 DNA methylation reprogramming. This is the first report of
                 findings showing that the CpG methylation state is

                 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the predominant form

                 of genomic alterations due to tobacco exposure. To uncover its
                 mutational landscape, we performed whole-exome sequencing in
                 31 NSCLCs and their matched normal tissue samples. We
                 identified both common and unique mutation spectra and pathway
                 activation in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell
                 carcinomas, two major histologies in NSCLC. In addition to
                 identifying previously known lung cancer genes (TP53, KRAS,
                 EGFR, CDKN2A and RB1), the analysis revealed many genes not

                 tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer
                 research. The consequent increased demand for somatic variant
                 analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to
                 model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any
                 practical level of tumor impurity.RESULTS:We describe Strelka,
                 a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from
                 sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method
                 uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous
                 allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while
                 leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This
                 is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of
                 germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor
                 sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic
                 variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is
                 that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity
                 without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the

                 mutations detected in a cohort of tumors is a key challenge in
                 cancer genomics. Traditionally, this is done by prioritizing
                 genes according to the recurrence of alterations that they
                 bear. However, this approach has some known limitations, such
                 as the difficulty to correctly estimate the background
                 mutation rate, and the fact that it cannot identify lowly
                 recurrently mutated driver genes. Here we present a novel
                 approach, Oncodrive-fm, to detect candidate cancer drivers
                 which does not rely on recurrence. First, we hypothesized that
                 any bias toward the accumulation of variants with high
                 functional impact observed in a gene or group of genes may be
                 an indication of positive selection and can thus be used to
                 detect candidate driver genes or gene modules. Next, we
                 developed a method to measure this bias (FM bias) and applied
                 it to three datasets of tumor somatic variants. As a proof of
                 concept of our hypothesis we show that most of the highly
                 recurrent and well-known cancer genes exhibit a clear FM bias.
                 Moreover, this novel approach avoids some known limitations of

                 difficulty in defining functionally important noncoding DNA.
                 Here, we combine genome-scale maps of regulatory DNA marked by
                 DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from 138 cell and tissue
                 types with whole-genome sequences of 53 geographically diverse

                 they are likely to have, on average, smaller effect sizes.

                 heterogeneity in the level of functional constraint in

                 specific locations in the genome is integral to the
                 orchestration of transcriptional regulation in cells. To
                 characterize transcription factor binding site function on a
                 large scale, we predicted and mutagenized 455 binding sites in
                 human promoters. We carried out functional tests on these
                 sites in four different immortalized human cell lines using
                 transient transfections with a luciferase reporter assay,
                 primarily for the transcription factors CTCF, GABP, GATA2,
                 E2F, STAT, and YY1. RESULTS: In each cell line, between 36\%
                 and 49\% of binding sites made a functional contribution to
                 the promoter activity; the overall rate for observing function
                 in any of the cell lines was 70\%. Transcription factor
                 binding resulted in transcriptional repression in more than a
                 third of functional sites. When compared with predicted
                 binding sites whose function was not experimentally verified,
                 the functional binding sites had higher conservation and were
                 located closer to transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Among
                 functional sites, repressive sites tended to be located
                 further from TSSs than were activating sites. Our data provide
                 significant insight into the functional characteristics of YY1
                 binding sites, most notably the detection of distinct
                 activating and repressing classes of YY1 binding sites.
                 Repressing sites were located closer to, and often overlapped
                 with, translational start sites and presented a distinctive
                 variation on the canonical YY1 binding motif. CONCLUSIONS: The
                 genomic properties that we found to associate with functional
                 TF binding sites on promoters -- conservation, TSS proximity,
                 motifs and their variations -- point the way to improved

  abstract    = "Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to
                 specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these
                 binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the
                 wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the
                 human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the
                 genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related
                 factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the
                 combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be
                 highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind
                 at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are
                 significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to
                 genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into
                 a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information
                 (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense
                 meta-network. Factors at different levels have different
                 properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more
                 strongly influence expression and middle-level ones
                 co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks.
                 Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched
                 network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward
                 loops). Finally, more connected network components are under
                 stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of
                 allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the
                 two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in
                 this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome

                 is usually mutagenic and may increase the level of sequence
                 divergence. However, methylated genes have been reported to
                 evolve more slowly than unmethylated genes. Hence, there is a
                 controversy on whether DNA methylation is correlated with
                 increased or decreased protein evolutionary rates. We
                 hypothesize that this controversy has resulted from the
                 differential correlations between DNA methylation and the
                 evolutionary rates of coding exons in different genic
                 positions. To test this hypothesis, we compare human-mouse and
                 human-macaque exonic evolutionary rates against experimentally
                 determined single-base resolution DNA methylation data derived
                 from multiple human cell types. We show that DNA methylation
                 is significantly related to within-gene variations in
                 evolutionary rates. First, DNA methylation level is more
                 strongly correlated with C-to-T mutations at CpG dinucleotides
                 in the first coding exons than in the internal and last exons,
                 although it is positively correlated with the synonymous
                 substitution rate in all exon positions. Second, for the first
                 exons, DNA methylation level is negatively correlated with
                 exonic expression level, but positively correlated with both
                 nonsynonymous substitution rate and the sample specificity of
                 DNA methylation level. For the internal and last exons,
                 however, we observe the opposite correlations. Our results
                 imply that DNA methylation level is differentially correlated
                 with the biological (and evolutionary) features of coding
                 exons in different genic positions. The first exons appear
                 more prone to the mutagenic effects, whereas the other exons
                 are more influenced by the regulatory effects of DNA

                 landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that
                 the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic
                 alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic
                 rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per
                 tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes,
                 including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously
                 unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A

                 a large amount of free text with limited machine

                 rearrangements: replication time, transcription rate and GC
                 content. The correlation is complex and different patterns are
                 observed between tumor types, within tumor types, and even
                 between different types of rearrangements. Mutations in the

                 DNA breakage in late replicating, low \%GC, untranscribed
                 regions of the genome. We show that somatic rearrangements
                 display less microhomology than germline rearrangements, and

                 biomedical text is of great value for cancer diagnostics,
                 treatment, and prevention. The immense body and rapid growth
                 of biomedical text on cancer has led to the appearance of a
                 large number of text mining techniques aimed at extracting
                 novel knowledge from scientific text. Biomedical text mining
                 on cancer research is computationally automatic and
                 high-throughput in nature. However, it is error-prone due to
                 the complexity of natural language processing. In this review,

                 prognostics and targeted therapeutics of cancer is to
                 comprehensively understand its molecular mechanisms.
                 Large-scale cancer genomics projects are providing a large
                 volume of data about genomic, epigenomic and gene expression
                 aberrations in multiple cancer types. One of the remaining
                 challenges is to identify driver mutations, driver genes and
                 driver pathways promoting cancer proliferation and filter out
                 the unfunctional and passenger ones.RESULTS:In this study, we
                 propose two methods to solve the so-called maximum weight
                 submatrix problem, which is designed to de novo identify
                 mutated driver pathways from mutation data in cancer. The
                 first one is an exact method that can be helpful for assessing
                 other approximate or/and heuristic algorithms. The second one
                 is a stochastic and flexible method that can be employed to
                 incorporate other types of information to improve the first
                 method. Particularly, we propose an integrative model to
                 combine mutation and expression data. We first apply our
                 methods onto simulated data to show their efficiency. We
                 further apply the proposed methods onto several real
                 biological datasets, such as the mutation profiles of 74 head
                 and neck squamous cell carcinomas samples, 90 glioblastoma
                 tumor samples and 313 ovarian carcinoma samples. The gene
                 expression profiles were also considered for the later two
                 data. The results show that our integrative model can identify
                 more biologically relevant gene sets. We have implemented all
                 these methods and made a package called mutated driver pathway

                 drivers. RESULTS: We have developed OncodriveCLUST, a method
                 to identify genes with a significant bias towards mutation
                 clustering within the protein sequence. This method constructs
                 the background model by assessing coding-silent mutations,
                 which are assumed not to be under positive selection and thus
                 may reflect the baseline tendency of somatic mutations to be
                 clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic
                 Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the
                 Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant
                 phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes,
                 which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters.
                 Assessment of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas
                 demonstrated that OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that
                 were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and

                 drivers will help characterize biological systems important in
                 multiple cancers and lead to development of better therapies.
                 Driver genes are most often identified by their recurrent
                 mutations across tumor samples. However, some mutations are
                 more important for protein function than others. Thus
                 considering the location of mutations with respect to
                 functional protein sites can predict their mechanisms of
                 action and improve the sensitivity of driver gene detection.
                 Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification
                 central to cancer biology and treatment, and frequently
                 altered by driver mutations. Here we used our ActiveDriver
                 method to analyze known phosphorylation sites mutated by
                 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in The Cancer Genome Atlas
                 Research Network (TCGA) pan-cancer dataset of 3,185 genomes
                 and 12 cancer types. Phosphorylation-related SNVs (pSNVs)
                 occur in ~90\% of tumors, show increased conservation and
                 functional mutation impact compared to other protein-coding
                 mutations, and are enriched in cancer genes and pathways.
                 Gene-centric analysis found 150 known and candidate cancer
                 genes with significant pSNV recurrence. Using a novel
                 computational method, we predict that 29\% of these mutations
                 directly abolish phosphorylation or modify kinase target sites

                 the level of non-CpG methylation decreases after the
                 resumption of mitosis in the neonatal period, whereas that of
                 CpG methylation does not. The cells eventually lose non-CpG
                 methylation by the time they become spermatogonia. Our results
                 show that non-CpG methylation accumulates in non-replicating,
                 arrested cells but is not maintained in mitotically dividing
                 cells during male germ-cell development.",

                 Identification of these genes and understanding their
                 functions are critical for further investigation of
                 tumorigenesis. So far, many studies have identified numerous
                 TSGs and illustrated their functions in various types of
                 tumors or normal samples. Furthermore, accumulating evidence
                 has shown that non-coding RNAs can act as TSGs to prevent the
                 tumorigenesis processes. Therefore, there is a growing demand
                 to integrate TSGs with large-scale experimental evidence (e.g.
                 gene expression and epigenetic signatures) to provide a

                 network of its own. It accommodates numerous nucleotide
                 signals that overlap protein coding sequences and are
                 responsible for multiple levels of regulation and generation
                 of biological complexity. A wealth of structural and
                 regulatory information, which mRNA carries in addition to the
                 encoded amino acid sequence, raises the question of how these
                 signals and overlapping codes are delineated along
                 non-synonymous and synonymous positions in protein coding
                 regions, especially in eukaryotes. Silent or synonymous codon
                 positions, which do not determine amino acid sequences of the
                 encoded proteins, define mRNA secondary structure and
                 stability and affect the rate of translation, folding and
                 post-translational modifications of nascent polypeptides. The
                 RNA level selection is acting on synonymous sites in both
                 prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is more common than previously
                 thought. Selection pressure on the coding gene regions follows
                 three-nucleotide periodic pattern of nucleotide base-pairing
                 in mRNA, which is imposed by the genetic code. Synonymous
                 positions of the coding regions have a higher level of
                 hybridization potential relative to non-synonymous positions,
                 and are multifunctional in their regulatory and structural
                 roles. Recent experimental evidence and analysis of mRNA
                 structure and interspecies conservation suggest that there is
                 an evolutionary tradeoff between selective pressure acting at
                 the RNA and protein levels. Here we provide a comprehensive
                 overview of the studies that define the role of silent

                 hypermethylated across cancer types are enriched for sites

                 expands the model of a stem/progenitor cell signature in

              informed methods for selection of targeted therapies to treat
              individual patients with cancer---so-called precision cancer
              medicine. Until 1980, most research on cancer therapy was not
              targeted in the sense we use the word today. Since then, there
              has been an acceleration in research identifying genetic and
              molecular targets and in clinical trials using biomarkers that
              identify the presence of genetic or molecular markers in a
              patient's cancer to select appropriate targeted therapy. This
              approach has been made possible by increased knowledge of the
              genetic pathogenesis of cancer and by increased capacity to
              sequence genes and genomes in clinically useful timeframes and at
              a reasonable cost. However, many challenges and pitfalls remain

                 alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of
                 thousands of additional mutations termed passengers.
                 Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet
                 many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other
                 functional elements that can have potentially deleterious
                 effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of
                 moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the
                 course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines
                 evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an
                 analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find
                 that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection
                 during progression. Although individually weak, the collective
                 burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading
                 to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with
                 a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the
                 predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and
                 confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have
                 largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model
                 to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of
                 passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii)
                 exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches
                 lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective
                 therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for

                 genome sequencing has revealed that many cancers, including
                 breast cancer, have somatic mutation spectra dominated by
                 C-to-T transitions. Most of these mutations occur at
                 hydrolytically disfavoured non-methylated cytosines throughout
                 the genome, and are sometimes clustered. Here we show that the
                 DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B is a probable source of these
                 mutations. APOBEC3B messenger RNA is upregulated in most
                 primary breast tumours and breast cancer cell lines. Tumours
                 that express high levels of APOBEC3B have twice as many
                 mutations as those that express low levels and are more likely
                 to have mutations in TP53. Endogenous APOBEC3B protein is
                 predominantly nuclear and the only detectable source of DNA
                 C-to-U editing activity in breast cancer cell-line extracts.
                 Knockdown experiments show that endogenous APOBEC3B correlates
                 with increased levels of genomic uracil, increased mutation
                 frequencies, and C-to-T transitions. Furthermore, induced
                 APOBEC3B overexpression causes cell cycle deviations, cell
                 death, DNA fragmentation, $\gamma$-H2AX accumulation and
                 C-to-T mutations. Our data suggest a model in which

              medicine by next-generation sequencing, it will be critically
              important to obtain accurate and consistent variant calls on
              personal genomes. Multiple software tools for variant calling are
              available, but it is unclear how comparable these tools are or
              what their relative merits in real-world scenarios might be.
              METHODS: We sequenced 15 exomes from four families using the
              Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and Agilent SureSelect v.2 capture
              kit, with ~120X mean coverage. We analyzed the raw data using
              near-default parameters with 5 different alignment and variant
              calling pipelines (SOAP, BWA-GATK, BWA-SNVer, GNUMAP, and
              BWA-SAMTools). We additionally sequenced a single whole genome
              using the Complete Genomics (CG) sequencing and analysis
              pipeline, with 95\% of the exome region being covered by 20 or
              more reads per base. Finally, we attempted to validate 919 SNVs
              and 841 indels, including similar fractions of GATK-only,
              SOAP-only, and shared calls, on the MiSeq platform by amplicon
              sequencing with ~5000X average coverage. RESULTS: SNV concordance
              between five Illumina pipelines across all 15 exomes is 57.4\%,
              while 0.5-5.1\% variants were called as unique to each pipeline.
              Indel concordance is only 26.8\% between three indel calling
              pipelines, even after left-normalizing and intervalizing genomic
              coordinates by 20 base pairs. 11\% of CG variants that fall
              within targeted regions in exome sequencing were not called by
              any of the Illumina-based exome analysis pipelines. Based on
              targeted amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform, 97.1\%,
              60.2\% and 99.1\% of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared SNVs can
              be validated, but only 54.0\%, 44.6\% and 78.1\% of the
              GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared indels can be validated.
              Additionally, our analysis of two families, one containing four
              individuals and the other containing seven, demonstrates
              additional accuracy gained in variant discovery by having access
              to genetic data from a multi-generational family. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results suggest that more caution should be exercised in
              genomic medicine settings when analyzing individual genomes,
              including interpreting positive and negative findings with
              scrutiny, especially for indels. We advocate for renewed
              collection and sequencing of multi-generational families, so as
              to increase the overall accuracy of whole genomes.",

                 abundant form of human genetic variation, but our
                 understanding of their origins and functional effects lags
                 behind that of other types of variants. Using population-scale
                 sequencing, we have identified a high-quality set of 1.6
                 million indels from 179 individuals representing three diverse
                 human populations. We show that rates of indel mutagenesis are
                 highly heterogeneous, with 43\%-48\% of indels occurring in
                 4.03\% of the genome, whereas in the remaining 96\% their
                 prevalence is 16 times lower than SNPs. Polymerase slippage
                 can explain upwards of three-fourths of all indels, with the
                 remainder being mostly simple deletions in complex sequence.
                 However, insertions do occur and are significantly associated
                 with pseudo-palindromic sequence features compatible with the
                 fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) mechanism more
                 commonly associated with large structural variations. We
                 introduce a quantitative model of polymerase slippage, which
                 enables us to identify indel-hypermutagenic protein-coding
                 genes, some of which are associated with recurrent mutations
                 leading to disease. Accounting for mutational rate
                 heterogeneity due to sequence context, we find that indels
                 across functional sequence are generally subject to stronger
                 purifying selection than SNPs. We find that indel length
                 modulates selection strength, and that indels affecting
                 multiple functionally constrained nucleotides undergo stronger
                 purifying selection. We further find that indels are enriched
                 in associations with gene expression and find evidence for a
                 contribution of nonsense-mediated decay. Finally, we show that
                 indels can be integrated in existing genome-wide association
                 studies (GWAS); although we do not find direct evidence that
                 potentially causal protein-coding indels are enriched with
                 associations to known disease-associated SNPs, our findings
                 suggest that the causal variant underlying some of these
                 associations may be indels.",

                 molecular function, and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNA
                 folding algorithms can provide detailed insights into
                 structural effects of SNPs. The global measures employed so
                 far suffer from limited accuracy of folding programs on large

                 applications. Here, we present a strategy that focuses on the
                 local regions of maximal structural change between mutant and
                 wild-type. These local regions are approximated in a
                 ``screening mode'' that is intended for genome-wide

                 disease is so far largely unknown. Here, using data from the
                 Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.org), we
                 identified 477 events to be TBSs (doublets, 448; triplets, 16;
                 and quadruplets to octuplets, 13). A comprehensive sequence
                 pattern and context analysis implied the likely fundamental
                 importance of translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases in
                 generating these diverse TBSs but revealed that TLS

                 whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing methods. However, a high
                 proportion of the amino acid substitutions detected in cancer
                 genomes have little or no effect on tumour progression
                 (passenger mutations). Therefore, accurate automated methods
                 capable of discriminating between driver (cancer-promoting)
                 and passenger mutations are becoming increasingly important.
                 In our previous work, we developed the Functional Analysis
                 through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and, using a
                 model weighted for inherited disease mutations, observed
                 improved performances over alternative computational
                 prediction algorithms. Here, we describe an adaptation of our
                 original algorithm which incorporates a cancer-specific model
                 to potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations.
                 RESULTS: The performance of our algorithm was evaluated using
                 two separate benchmarks. In our analysis, we observed improved

                 neutral mutations). In addition, when discriminating between
                 somatic driver and passenger mutations, we observed

                 multiple driver pathways de novo in somatic mutation data from
                 a cohort of cancer samples. The algorithm relies on two
                 combinatorial properties of mutations in a driver pathway:
                 high coverage and mutual exclusivity. We derive an integer

                 properties. We apply Multi-Dendrix to somatic mutations from

                 Multi-Dendrix identifies sets of mutations in genes that

                 contrast to duplicated non-disease genes of similar age. We
                 propose that functional compensation by duplication of genes
                 masks the phenotypic effects of deleterious mutations and
                 reduces the probability of purging the defective genes from
                 the human population; this functional compensation could be
                 further enhanced by higher purification selection between
                 disease genes and their duplicates as well as their
                 orthologous counterpart compared to non-disease genes.
                 However, due to the intrinsic expression stochasticity among
                 individuals, the deleterious mutations could still be present
                 as genetic diseases in some subpopulations where the duplicate
                 copies are expressed at low abundances. Consequently the
                 defective genes are linked to genetic disorders while they
                 continue propagating within the population. Our results
                 provide insight into the molecular basis underlying the

                 Genome-wide regulatory and gene expression profiles measured
                 across individuals and diseases reflect downstream effects of
                 genetic variation and may allow for functional assessment of
                 disease-associated loci. Here, we present a unique approach
                 for systematic integration of genetic disease associations,
                 transcription factor binding among individuals, and gene
                 expression data to assess the functional consequences of
                 variants associated with hundreds of human diseases. In an
                 analysis of genome-wide binding profiles of NF$\kappa$B, we
                 find that disease-associated SNPs are enriched in NF$\kappa$B

                 inflammatory-mediated diseases, such as asthma, rheumatoid
                 arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Using genome-wide
                 variation in transcription factor-binding data, we find that
                 NF$\kappa$B binding is often correlated with
                 disease-associated variants in a genotype-specific and
                 allele-specific manner. Furthermore, we show that this binding
                 variation is often related to expression of nearby genes,
                 which are also found to have altered expression in independent

                 for the p53 transcription factor that incorporates sequence

                 variations in complex diseases in the post-genomic era. It has
                 also been used for assisting the creation of disease-related
                 mutation databases. Most of existing approaches are rule-based
                 and focus on limited types of sequence variations, such as
                 protein point mutations. Thus, extending their extraction
                 scope requires significant manual efforts in examining new
                 instances and developing corresponding rules. As such, new
                 automatic approaches are greatly needed for extracting

                 types of mutations that were not considered in past studies.
                 Using a novel CRF label model and feature set, our method
                 achieves higher performance than a state-of-the-art method on
                 both our corpus (91.4 versus 78.1\% in F-measure) and their

                 distributions and loads for 19 different cancer types, with
                 over 4,800 exomes and 1,000,000 somatic mutations. Notably,
                 APOBEC3B is upregulated, and its preferred target sequence is
                 frequently mutated and clustered in at least six distinct
                 cancers: bladder, cervix, lung (adenocarcinoma and squamous
                 cell carcinoma), head and neck, and breast. Interpreting these
                 findings in the light of previous genetic, cellular and
                 biochemical studies, the most parsimonious conclusion from
                 these global analyses is that APOBEC3B-catalyzed genomic
                 uracil lesions are responsible for a large proportion of both
                 dispersed and clustered mutations in multiple distinct

                 lie within the affected gene, sequence variation in complex
                 disorders is more commonly found in noncoding regions.
                 Furthermore, recent genome- wide studies have shown that
                 common DNA sequence variants in noncoding regions are
                 associated with ``normal'' variation in gene expression
                 resulting in cell-specific and/or allele-specific differences.
                 The mechanism by which such sequence variation causes changes
                 in gene expression is largely unknown. We have addressed this
                 by studying natural variation in the binding of key
                 transcription factors (TFs) in the well-defined, purified cell
                 system of erythropoiesis. We have shown that common
                 polymorphisms frequently directly perturb the binding sites of
                 key TFs, and detailed analysis shows how this causes
                 considerable (∼10-fold) changes in expression from a single
                 allele in a tissue-specific manner. We also show how a SNP,
                 located at some distance from the recognized TF binding site,
                 may affect the recruitment of a large multiprotein complex and
                 alter the associated chromatin modification of the variant
                 regulatory element. This study illustrates the principles by
                 which common sequence variation may cause changes in
                 tissue-specific gene expression, and suggests that such
                 variation may underlie an individual's propensity to develop
                 complex human genetic diseases.",

                 considered more likely to induce endogenous mutations and a
                 clear male bias has been demonstrated from recent
                 next-generation sequencing analyses. As new experimental
                 evidence accumulates, the post-meiotic events of the male
                 gametogenesis (spermiogenesis) appear as an ideal context to
                 induce de novo genetic polymorphism transmittable to the next
                 generation. It may prove to be a major component of the
                 observed male mutation bias. As spermatids undergo chromatin
                 remodeling, transient endogenous DNA double-stranded breaks

  abstract    = "Single base substitutions constitute the most frequent type of
                 human gene mutation and are a leading cause of cancer and
                 inherited disease. These alterations occur non-randomly in
                 DNA, being strongly influenced by the local nucleotide
                 sequence context. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
                 such sequence context-dependent mutagenesis are not fully
                 understood. Using bioinformatics, computational and molecular
                 modeling analyses, we have determined the frequencies of
                 mutation at G•C bp in the context of all 64 5'-NGNN-3' motifs
                 that contain the mutation at the second position. Twenty-four
                 datasets were employed, comprising >530,000 somatic single
                 base substitutions from 21 cancer genomes, >77,000 germline
                 single-base substitutions causing or associated with human
                 inherited disease and 16.7 million benign germline
                 single-nucleotide variants. In several cancer types, the
                 number of mutated motifs correlated both with the free
                 energies of base stacking and the energies required for
                 abstracting an electron from the target guanines (ionization
                 potentials). Similar correlations were also evident for the
                 pathological missense and nonsense germline mutations, but
                 only when the target guanines were located on the
                 non-transcribed DNA strand. Likewise, pathogenic splicing
                 mutations predominantly affected positions in which a purine
                 was located on the non-transcribed DNA strand. Novel candidate
                 driver mutations and tissue-specific mutational patterns were
                 also identified in the cancer datasets. We conclude that
                 electron transfer reactions within the DNA molecule contribute
                 to sequence context-dependent mutagenesis, involving both
                 somatic driver and passenger mutations in cancer, as well as
                 germline alterations causing or associated with inherited
                 disease.",
