  abstract = "Sequencing tests assaying panels of genes or whole exomes are
              widely available for cancer risk evaluation. However, methods for
              classification of variants resulting from this testing are not
              well studied. We evaluated the ability of a
              variant-classification methodology based on American College of
              Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to define the
              rate of mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in
              180 medically relevant genes, including all ACMG-designated
              reportable cancer and non-cancer-associated genes, in individuals
              who met guidelines for hereditary cancer risk evaluation. We
              performed whole-exome sequencing in 404 individuals in 253
              families and classified 1,640 variants. Potentially clinically
              actionable (likely pathogenic [LP] or pathogenic [P]) versus
              nonactionable (VUS, likely benign, or benign) calls were 95\%
              concordant with locus-specific databases and Clinvar. LP or P
              mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer
              susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2
              mutations (11\%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated
              with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P
              mutations in only two additional families (0.8\%). However,
              individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9\%) had incidental LP or
              P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9\% of
              individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation
              in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer
              susceptibility. Furthermore, 95\% of individuals had at least one
              VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG
              variant-classification guidelines. Additionally, evaluation of
              extended panels of cancer-associated genes in breast/ovarian
              cancer families leads to only an incremental clinical benefit but
              substantially increases the complexity of the results.",

              previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence
              variants.(1) In the past decade, sequencing technology has
              evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput
              next-generation sequencing. By adopting and leveraging
              next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now
              performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing
              spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes,
              transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By
              virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has
              been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In
              this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising
              representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular
              Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to
              revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the
              interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of
              clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report
              represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG,
              AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These
              recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests
              used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single
              genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the
              use of specific standard terminology-``pathogenic,'' ``likely
              pathogenic,'' ``uncertain significance,'' ``likely benign,'' and
              ``benign''-to describe variants identified in genes that cause
              Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a
              process for classifying variants into these five categories based
              on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g.,
              population data, computational data, functional data, segregation
              data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and
              interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this
              report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular
              genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory
              Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory, with results
              interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: To truly achieve personalized medicine in
                 oncology, it is critical to catalog and curate cancer sequence
                 variants for their clinical relevance. The Somatic Working
                 Group (WG) of the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), in
                 cooperation with ClinVar and multiple cancer variant curation
                 stakeholders, has developed a consensus set of minimal variant
                 level data (MVLD). MVLD is a framework of standardized data
                 elements to curate cancer variants for clinical utility. With
                 implementation of MVLD standards, and in a working partnership
                 with ClinVar, we aim to streamline the somatic variant
                 curation efforts in the community and reduce redundancy and
                 time burden for the interpretation of cancer variants in
                 clinical practice. METHODS: We developed MVLD through a
                 consensus approach by i) reviewing clinical actionability
                 interpretations from institutions participating in the WG, ii)
                 conducting extensive literature search of clinical somatic
                 interpretation schemas, and iii) survey of cancer variant web
                 portals. A forthcoming guideline on cancer variant
                 interpretation, from the Association of Molecular Pathology
                 (AMP), can be incorporated into MVLD. RESULTS: Along with
                 harmonizing standardized terminology for allele interpretive
                 and descriptive fields that are collected by many databases,
                 the MVLD includes unique fields for cancer variants such as
                 Biomarker Class, Therapeutic Context and Effect. In addition,
                 MVLD includes recommendations for controlled semantics and
                 ontologies. The Somatic WG is collaborating with ClinVar to
                 evaluate MVLD use for somatic variant submissions. ClinVar is
                 an open and centralized repository where sequencing
                 laboratories can report summary-level variant data with
                 clinical significance, and ClinVar accepts cancer variant
                 data. CONCLUSIONS: We expect the use of the MVLD to streamline
                 clinical interpretation of cancer variants, enhance
                 interoperability among multiple redundant curation efforts,
                 and increase submission of somatic variants to ClinVar, all of
                 which will enhance translation to clinical oncology practice.",

                 into the mutational processes that have shaped the cancer
                 genome, but such analysis currently requires large cohorts. We
                 develop deconstructSigs, which allows the identification of
                 mutational signatures within a single tumor sample. RESULTS:
                 Application of deconstructSigs identifies samples with DNA
                 repair deficiencies and reveals distinct and dynamic
                 mutational processes molding the cancer genome in esophageal

                 tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer
                 research. The consequent increased demand for somatic variant
                 analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to
                 model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any
                 practical level of tumor impurity.RESULTS:We describe Strelka,
                 a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from
                 sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method
                 uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous
                 allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while
                 leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This
                 is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of
                 germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor
                 sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic
                 variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is
                 that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity
                 without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the

                 processes of mutagenesis. The clinical application of
                 mutational signatures is not well defined. Here we aim to
                 assess the prognostic utility of mutational signatures in
                 ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. METHODS: Open access data
                 of 15,439 somatic mutations of 310 ovarian high-grade serous
                 carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are used to
                 construct a Bayesian model to classify each cancer as either
                 having or lacking a BRCA1/2 mutational signature. We evaluate
                 the association of the BRCA1/2 signature with overall survival
                 on the TCGA dataset and on an independent cohort of 92 ovarian
                 high-grade serous carcinomas from the Australian Ovarian
                 Cancer Study (AOCS). RESULTS: Patients from TCGA with tumors
                 harboring the BRCA1/2 mutational signature have improved
                 survival (55.2 months vs. 38.0 months), which is independent
                 of BRCA1/2 gene mutation status, age, stage, and grade (HR =
                 0.64; P = 0.02). In the AOCS dataset, the BRCA1/2 mutational
                 signature is also associated with improved overall survival
                 (46.3 months vs. 23.6 months) independent of age and stage (HR
                 = 0.52; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: A BRCA1/2 mutational
                 signature is a prognostic marker in ovarian high-grade serous
                 carcinoma. Mutational signature analysis of ovarian cancer

                 identified via next generation sequencing technologies remains
                 a major challenge. Many such variants occur in tumor genes
                 that have well-established biological and clinical relevance
                 and are putative targets of molecular therapy, however, most
                 variants are still of unknown significance. With large amounts

                 targeted therapy trials have thus far been disappointing owing
                 to a lack of robust stratification methods. Whole-genome
                 sequencing (WGS) analysis of 129 cases demonstrated that this
                 is a heterogeneous cancer dominated by copy number alterations
                 with frequent large-scale rearrangements. Co-amplification of
                 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and/or downstream mitogenic
                 activation is almost ubiquitous; thus tailored combination RTK
                 inhibitor (RTKi) therapy might be required, as we demonstrate
                 in vitro. However, mutational signatures showed three distinct
                 molecular subtypes with potential therapeutic relevance, which
                 we verified in an independent cohort (n = 87): (i) enrichment

   abstract    = "BACKGROUND: High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an emerging
                  biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors and
                  has been shown to be more significantly associated with
                  response to PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy than PD-1 or
                  PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
                  The distribution of TMB and the subset of patients with high
                  TMB has not been well characterized in the majority of cancer
                  types. METHODS: In this study, we compare TMB measured by a
                  targeted comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to TMB
                  measured by exome sequencing and simulate the expected
                  variance in TMB when sequencing less than the whole exome. We
                  then describe the distribution of TMB across a diverse cohort
                  of 100,000 cancer cases and test for association between
                  somatic alterations and TMB in over 100 tumor types. RESULTS:
                  We demonstrate that measurements of TMB from comprehensive
                  genomic profiling are strongly reflective of measurements from
                  whole exome sequencing and model that below 0.5 Mb the
                  variance in measurement increases significantly. We find that
                  a subset of patients exhibits high TMB across almost all types
                  of cancer, including many rare tumor types, and characterize
                  the relationship between high TMB and microsatellite
                  instability status. We find that TMB increases significantly
                  with age, showing a 2.4-fold difference between age 10 and age
                  90 years. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of TMB
                  and identify genes and mutations associated with TMB level. We
                  identify a cluster of somatic mutations in the promoter of the
                  gene PMS2, which occur in 10\% of skin cancers and are highly
                  associated with increased TMB. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
                  that a CGP assay targeting ~1.1 Mb of coding genome can
                  accurately assess TMB compared with sequencing the whole
                  exome. Using this method, we find that many disease types have
                  a substantial portion of patients with high TMB who might
                  benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we identify novel,
                  recurrent promoter mutations in PMS2, which may be another
                  example of regulatory mutations contributing to tumorigenesis.",
