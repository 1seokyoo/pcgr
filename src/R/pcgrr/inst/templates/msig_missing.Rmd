## Mutational signatures

The number of SNV calls (n = `r pcg_report[['snv_indel']][['variant_statistic']][['n_snv']]`) is too limited. A minimum of `r pcg_report[['pcgr_config']][['mutational_signatures']][['mutsignatures_mutation_limit']]` SNVs is currently required for a mutational signature analysis to be performed (this number can be configured in the PCGR configuration file).
