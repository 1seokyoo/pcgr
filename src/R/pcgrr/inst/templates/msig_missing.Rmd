## Mutational signatures

The number of SNV calls (n = `r nrow(report_data$sample_calls_SNVs)`) is too limited. A minimum of `r report_data$mutational_signatures_data$mutation_limit` SNVs is currently required for a mutational signature analysis to be performed (this number can be configured in the PCGR configuration file).
