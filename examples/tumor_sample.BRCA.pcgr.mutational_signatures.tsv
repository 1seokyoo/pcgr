Signature_ID	Weight	Cancer_types	Proposed_aetiology	SampleID
S1	0.456	All cancer types	Endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, correlates with aging.	tumor_sample.BRCA
S13	0.279	22 cancer tyeps, most common in cervical and bladder cancers (usually in > 10% of samples)	S13 has been attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases converting cytosine to uracil. On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family. Signature 13 causes predominantly C>G mutations. This may be due to generation of abasic sites after removal of uracil by base excision repair and replication over these abasic sites by REV1	tumor_sample.BRCA
S7	0.167	Predominantly in skin cancers and in cancers of the lip categorized as head and neck or oral squamous cancers	Based on its prevalence in ultraviolet exposed areas and the similarity of the mutational pattern to that observed in experimental systems exposed to ultraviolet light S7 is likely due to ultraviolet light exposure	tumor_sample.BRCA
S2	0.098	22 cancer types, most commonly in cervical and bladder cancers (usually in > 10% of samples)	Activity of AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases (APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B)	tumor_sample.BRCA
