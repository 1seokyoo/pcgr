# NCGC - functional annotation of somatic DNA variation

## Introduction

The NCGC functional annotation workflow contains a set of software tools and comprehensive genomic datasets for annotation and interpretation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions/deletions (InDels), and copy number segments discovered from high-throughput sequencing. Currently, it builds largely upon [Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) and [vcfanno](http://github.com/brentp/vcfanno). It has the following focus:

* Cancer relevance
* Coding sequence variants (i.e. exome-type studies)
* *insilico* predictions of effect of coding variants
* Overlap with existing variant databases, both somatic (e.g. hotspots in different tumor types) and germline
* Clinical utility (i.e. clinical variant associations, drug-gene interactions, drug sensitivity markers etc.)

## Output

### Somatic SNVs/InDels

#### 1. Variant call format - VCF

Each tumor-normal sample pair is provided with an annotated VCF file with the following naming convention:

_\<sample\_pair\_identifier\>.pass.all.annotated.vcf.gz_

Copy number segments have been intersected with the genomic coordinates of all transcripts from ENSEMBL/GENCODE. In adddition, we attach cancer-relevant annotations for the affected transcripts. The naming convention of the compressed TSV file is as follows:

_\<sample\_pair\_identifier\>.facets.cnv.annotated.gz_

The format of the TSV file is the following:

	1.chrom - chromosome
  	2.segment_start - start of copy number segment determined by FACETS
  	3.segment_end - end of copy number segment determined by FACETS
  	4.segment_length - length of segment in Mb
  	5.cf - estimated cellular fraction
  	6.LogR - Copy log-ratio
  	7.cnTotal - Estimated total copy number
  	8.cnMinor - Estimated minor copy number
  	9.ensembl_gene_id
  	10.symbol - gene symbol
  	11.ensembl_transcript_id
  	12.transcript_start
  	13.transcript_end
  	14.transcript_overlap_percent - percent of transcript length covered by CN segment
  	15.name - gene name description
  	16.gene_biotype - type of gene
  	17.cancer_census_germline - gene implicated with germline
  	   predisposition to various cancer subtypes
  	18.cancer_census_somatic - gene for which somatic mutations
  	   have been causally implicated in tumor development
  	19.tsgene - tumor suppressor gene status (TSgene 2.0 database)
  	20.tsgene_oncogene - oncogene status (TSgene 2.0 database)
  	21.intogen_drivers - predicted driver gene status (IntoGen Cancer Drivers Database)
  	22.antineoplastic_drugs_dgidb - validated and experimental
  	   antineoplastic drugs interacting with gene
  	23.gencode_v19 - transcript is part of GENCODE V19
