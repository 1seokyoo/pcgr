What is the Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR) is a stand-alone software
package intended for analysis and clinical interpretation of individual
cancer genomes. It interprets both somatic SNVs/InDels and copy number
aberrations. The software extends basic gene and variant annotations
from the `Ensemblâ€™s Variant Effect Predictor
(VEP) <http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html>`__ with
oncology-relevant, up-to-date annotations retrieved flexibly through
`vcfanno <https://github.com/brentp/vcfanno>`__, and produces HTML
reports that can be navigated by clinical oncologists (Figure 1).

Why use PCGR?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The great complexity of acquired mutations in individual tumor genomes
poses a severe challenge for clinical interpretation. There is a general
scarcity of tools that can i) systematically interrogate cancer genomes
in the context of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers,
ii) prioritize and highlight the most important findings, and iii)
present the results in a format accessible to clinical experts. PCGR
integrates a comprehensive set of knowledge resources related to tumor
biology and therapeutic biomarkers, both at the gene and variant level.
The application generates a tiered report that will aid the
interpretation of individual cancer genomes in a clinical setting.
